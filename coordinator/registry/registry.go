// Package registry tracks connected providers and routes inference requests.
//
// Routing applies model, trust, privacy, health, and capacity gates, then ranks
// candidates by estimated latency and load. Near-cost candidates spread requests
// by queue depth; verified prefix-cache evidence can resolve otherwise equal
// choices. Reservations revalidate provider state before committing capacity.
//
// Registry owns fleet-wide state and construction. Provider and PendingRequest
// own connection and request state; model inventory, loading, heartbeat ingestion,
// attestation policy, and read-only fleet views live in their respective modules.
// Provider disconnection and stale-heartbeat eviction clean up session state while
// bounded identity gates preserve applicable fault history across reconnects.
