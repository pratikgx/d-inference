# Quickstart: first request in five steps

> Last updated: 2026-09-28 · commit `d89ef42be`

Get an API key from the console, list the models your key can use, and make your first chat completion against `https://api.darkbloom.dev` — first with `curl`, then from the OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs. For developers integrating the API; each step is one action. Route details for everything used here are in [`../reference/api-contracts.md`](../reference/api-contracts.md).

## Prerequisites

- For `/v1/responses`, put a system prompt in the string `instructions` field. The coordinator places it before `input` and includes it in admission estimates; see the [Responses contract](../reference/api-contracts.md#responses-api).
- Forced media tools and image/video tool results require a model/provider with native media-tool support. Preserve the actual returned tool-call IDs when sending results; an ordinary vision capability alone is insufficient. See the [tool and vision rules](../reference/api-contracts.md).
- An email address. Email is the only console login method (`loginMethods: ["email"]`, `console-ui/src/components/app-providers/PrivyRealProvider.tsx`); there is no wallet or social login. The Privy account it creates is what your API keys, balance and usage attach to.
- Credit on the account. A chat completion reserves its worst-case cost before dispatch and is refused with a 402 when the balance cannot cover it; deposit first with [`billing.md`](billing.md).
- `curl` and `jq` for the shell steps; Python with the `openai` or `anthropic` package for the SDK steps.

## Steps

### 1. Sign in to the console

Open `https://console.darkbloom.dev` and sign in with your email address.

### 2. Create an API key

Open the API console page (`/api-console`, `console-ui/src/app/api-console/page.tsx` — not Settings) and create a key. The console calls `POST /v1/keys` with your Privy session through its same-origin `/api/keys` relay (`console-ui/src/app/api/keys/route.ts`; `handleCreateAPIKey`, `coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`). The secret starts with `sk-db-` and is shown once — copy it now; its exact shape and how it is stored are in [`../reference/api-contracts.md#api-key-shapes`](../reference/api-contracts.md#api-key-shapes). If you lose it, rotate or create another ([`authentication.md`](authentication.md)).

Export it for the commands below:

```bash
export DARKBLOOM_API_KEY="sk-db-..."
```

### 3. Verify the key and pick a model

```bash
curl -s https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DARKBLOOM_API_KEY" | jq '.data[] | {id, context_length, input_modalities, supported_features}'
```

A 200 with a `data` array confirms the key works (`handleListModels`, `coordinator/api/models_endpoints.go`). The `id` values are the model names to send; they are aliases maintained in the coordinator's database, so the list is authoritative and this page does not repeat it. Field meanings are in [`models.md`](models.md).

Pick one id and export it:

```bash
export MODEL="<an id from the list>"
```

### 4. Make a chat completion

```bash
curl -s https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DARKBLOOM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "'"$MODEL"'",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one sentence."}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

The body is an OpenAI `chat.completion` object whose `model` field echoes the alias you sent and whose `usage` has `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`. Response headers `X-Provider-Id`, `X-Provider-Attested` and `X-Timing` tell you which machine served it and how long each coordinator stage took (`writeCommittedProviderHeaders`, `coordinator/api/response_metadata.go`).

Expect a short delay before the first byte: the coordinator sends nothing until a provider has produced content, so it can still fail over or return a real error status in the meantime (`commitFirstContent`, `coordinator/api/dispatch.go`).

### 5. Stream the response

```bash
curl -N https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DARKBLOOM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "'"$MODEL"'",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Count from 1 to 10."}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

You receive `text/event-stream` frames, one `data: {...}` chunk per provider token group, a final frame carrying `usage` and `finish_reason`, then exactly one `data: [DONE]`. There are no keepalive comments; silence means no token has been produced yet (`handleStreamingResponseWithFirstChunkAndError`, `coordinator/api/consumer_stream.go`).

### 6. Use the OpenAI SDK

The OpenAI clients append `/chat/completions` to the base URL, so point them at `/v1`:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1", api_key=DARKBLOOM_API_KEY)
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one sentence."}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

`client.models.list()` and `client.responses.create(...)` also work: they hit `GET /v1/models` and `POST /v1/responses`, both registered routes. Endpoints the coordinator does not implement (embeddings, moderations, files) return a structured 404 from the `/v1/` catch-all (`handleUnimplementedEndpoint`, `coordinator/api/server.go`).

### 7. Use the Anthropic SDK

The Anthropic clients append `/v1/messages` to the base URL, so point them at the bare host. The coordinator reads credentials only from `Authorization: Bearer` (`extractBearerToken`, `coordinator/api/server.go`) and ignores `x-api-key`, so pass the key as the SDK's bearer `auth_token`, not as `api_key`:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(base_url="https://api.darkbloom.dev", auth_token=DARKBLOOM_API_KEY)
msg = client.messages.create(
    model=MODEL,
    max_tokens=64,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one sentence."}],
)
print(msg.content[0].text)
```

Requests land on `POST /v1/messages` (`handleAnthropicMessages`, `coordinator/api/consumer.go`) and are translated to the same pipeline as chat completions.

## Handling overload

If inference returns HTTP 429, wait for `Retry-After` before retrying, or choose
another available model. Internal attempts spend the original first-content
budget; they do not restart it. See the [error and retry contract](../reference/api-contracts.md#first-content-routing-and-retry-behavior).

## Verify

For a vision-capable model, Responses requests may use ordered inline
`input_image` parts or canonical `video_url` parts, including in tool outputs.
Use `data:` URIs; remote media and uploaded file IDs are not supported on this
endpoint. See the [Responses request contract](../reference/api-contracts.md#responses-api)
for supported forms and the distinct cache-planning boundary.

- Step 3 returned 200 with a non-empty `data` array.
- The step 4 response is a `chat.completion` object whose `model` echoes the alias you sent, whose `usage` is populated, and which carries an `X-Provider-Id` header.
- `GET /v1/payments/usage` with the same bearer lists the request and its `cost_micro_usd` ([`billing.md`](billing.md#3-read-your-balance-and-usage)).

To display network activity, read `GET /v1/stats`, `GET /v1/network/totals`,
or `GET /v1/network/series`. If one returns 503 `service_unavailable`, keep
your last displayed value and retry later; do not replace it with zero.
Successful empty windows are valid data.

The Stats page also shows **Model demand & fulfillment**. Select 24 hours,
7 days or 30 days, sort by published request volume or capacity rejections, and
expand a model to inspect outcomes. Use the demand-history controls to select
a model and chart published requests, capacity rejections, timeouts, service
errors or completion rate. Hover, tap or use arrow keys for exact published
counts; expand the interval table or download its CSV for analysis. Hatched
intervals contain no publishable hours, not measured zeros, and CSV exports leave
their counts blank. Larger display intervals can include only some of their hours.
`GET /v1/network/model-demand?window=24h` exposes the
same aggregates. Only UTC hours meeting the per-model request and consumer
privacy floors contribute to summaries or charts; these are not complete window
totals. Counts cover recorded public requests reaching routing admission;
private routes, account-limit failures and invalid requests are excluded.
Internal retries do not add requests, but client retries do. The page labels
partial history and best-effort recording. An empty result does not establish
zero demand. Data is delayed by at least one hour. A 429 count overlaps outcomes
and is not itself a capacity rejection count.
The [public stats contract](../reference/api-contracts.md#public-stats-and-health-5)
defines refresh intervals, maximum cached staleness, and window aliases.

## Troubleshooting

Direct accounts do not have the upstream first-content SLA. Allow enough time for model loading and prefill in your client timeout. Queue, inference-stall and cancellation limits still apply. Accounts explicitly selected by the operator, such as OpenRouter, retain their configured first-content budget and model exceptions. See [timeouts](../reference/api-contracts.md) and [SLA configuration](../reference/configuration.md#routing-admission-and-ttft).

| Response | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 400 `invalid_request_error` naming an output-token field | A negative or malformed `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens` or `max_output_tokens` | Use a positive integer bound or omit it for the coordinator default; null and zero retain default-bound behavior ([request contract](../reference/api-contracts.md#inference-4)) |
| 401 `authentication_error` | `Authorization: Bearer` header missing, or the key is unknown, disabled, expired or revoked | Re-export the key; create or rotate one in the console ([`authentication.md`](authentication.md)) |
| 402 | Balance or key budget cannot cover the worst-case reservation ([payment-required taxonomy](../architecture/billing.md#payment-required-responses)) | Deposit, or lower `max_tokens` ([`billing.md`](billing.md)) |
| 403 `model_not_allowed` | The key was created with an `allowed_models` list that excludes this model | Pick an id from the list, or `PATCH` the key ([`authentication.md`](authentication.md)) |
| 404 `model_not_found` | The `model` is not an id that `GET /v1/models` returns | Use an id from step 3 ([`models.md`](models.md)) |
| 503 `model_unavailable` (no `Retry-After`) | No routable provider for the model right now | Retry later, or pick another model ([`models.md`](models.md)) |
| 429 `rate_limit_exceeded` with `Retry-After` | Key `rpm_limit`, the account limiter, or the token-per-minute limits | Wait `Retry-After` seconds ([`../reference/api-contracts.md`](../reference/api-contracts.md#error-envelope-and-status-codes)) |
| Silence before the first byte | Expected: nothing is sent until a provider has produced content (`commitFirstContent`) | Wait; a real error status can still arrive |

Prompt length includes the model's rendered template, tools and conversation
history. The service can count this work before dispatch and reconcile it at the
provider without changing your completion limit or billing usage. A retry uses
the original remaining first-content budget. Capacity refusals retain the
existing `429` and `Retry-After` behavior; see the
[API contract](../reference/api-contracts.md).
