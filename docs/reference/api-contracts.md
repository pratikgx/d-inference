# HTTP API contracts

> Last updated: 2026-09-28 · commit `d89ef42be`

The complete public HTTP surface of the coordinator, derived from the 115 `HandleFunc` registrations in `routes()` (`coordinator/api/server.go`), including the `/v1/` catch-all. Every route is listed once below with its handler symbol, authentication requirement, and rate-limit bucket; the second half of the page gives the wire shapes, headers, error table, SSE framing, limits, timeouts, and version-gate semantics that those routes share. For *why* the pipeline is built this way see [`../architecture/components/consumer.md`](../architecture/components/consumer.md); for the crypto model behind sealed transport see [`../architecture/security/encryption.md`](../architecture/security/encryption.md).

Production base URL: `https://api.darkbloom.dev`. Unless a file is named, handler symbols below live in `coordinator/api/server.go`.

The public model catalog optionally includes `hugging_face_artifact` for direct
provider downloads; the admin registration accepts the same object. See the
[registry artifact contract](model-registry-format.md#hugging-face-download-artifact).

Admin request-profile records expose additive
[prediction decision fields](prediction-decision-telemetry.md). Public inference
responses and error codes are unchanged.

## Graceful provider lifecycle

Lifecycle drains preserve the existing public inference protocol. A reservation
that reaches a newly draining provider's final writer is retried as transient
503 capacity, with no sent frame or new usage debit. Already accepted requests
continue through their normal streaming/non-streaming terminal and settlement
paths. The additive [provider WebSocket barrier](protocol-messages.md#provider-lifecycle-drain)
is connection-scoped and never exposed as an unauthenticated HTTP stop endpoint.
The unified local API refuses new admissions with 503 during drain and tracks
accepted response bodies until their final write. This applies to local-only
CLI replacement as well as coordinator-connected providers; CLI lifecycle
control remains private to the local OS user.

The `trust_status.authorization` readiness diagnostic can use `self_route` for
an account-owned connection that passes existing self/preferred-owner liveness
and privacy gates below the public trust floor. It does not grant public-fleet
eligibility or bypass per-model dispatch checks. Code:
`coordinator/registry/owner_authorization.go` (`ProviderOwnerServingAuthorized`)
and `coordinator/api/app_attest.go` (`providerServingAuthorizationStatus`).

## Verification presentation contract

`X-Provider-Authorization-Method` is `app_attest`, `legacy`, `dual`, or `none`.
`X-Provider-Verification` is compact JSON with `observed_at`, `app_attest`, and
`legacy`. Each method has `state` and optional `verified_at` / `expires_at`
(exclusive Unix seconds). Server states are `verified`, `pending`, `expired`,
`revoked`, `unsupported`, and `offline`; missing metadata is unknown. Unsupported
means the registered App Attest protocol lacks the qualified protocol 3 path,
not an inference from a reported OS version. Times absent from the response are
unavailable. No certificate, receipt, account, credential, serial or canonical
machine identifier is included. Code: `coordinator/registry/verification.go`
(`ProviderVerification`).

For inference these fields are frozen at `authorizeInferenceHandoff` in
`coordinator/registry/inference_authorization.go`, after the writer queue and
last authorization check. The winning attempt's snapshot is used for headers
and opt-in chat `metadata.verification` even if its grant expires or is revoked
before the first response byte. Existing `X-Provider-Trust-Level` and MDA fields
keep their legacy meaning. The console proxy forwards the verification and
provider-hop encryption headers; it does not construct them from provider output.
The server decides `verified` with precise time before dispatch; Unix-second
serialization can make a valid final fractional second show equal `observed_at`
and `expires_at`. Historical display preserves that frozen server verdict,
while live views still expire grants at the recorded deadline. Public network statistics are explicitly historical source observations: `summarizeSnapshotVerification` in `console-ui/src/lib/verification.ts` keeps those method counts stable until the next snapshot, while the stats header exposes age. Directory filters and proof details use that same observation. Owner dashboard/removal controls continue to use live expiry; a stale statistics snapshot never grants permission to serve.

`GET /v1/me/providers`, `GET /v1/providers/attestation`, and individual public
`GET /v1/stats` provider rows include the same `verification` object evaluated
at snapshot time. Owner records with no live connection are offline. Connected but untrusted owned
providers retain their live verification verdict (including revocation), while
serving authorization remains false. Owner `verification`,
`app_attest_authorized` and expiry are checked with current account and status
in one registry/provider-locked observation (`ProviderVerificationAndAuthorization` in
`coordinator/registry/verification.go`), so grant changes cannot mix opposing
verdicts in one row. Unknown App Attest protocol versions remain `unsupported`;
only protocol 3 can show a pending current authorization path. Public attestation rows capture verification,
compatibility authorization flags, and catalog models in one registry/provider
locked walk (`ForEachProviderVerification` in `coordinator/registry/verification.go`).
Stats rows and geography aggregates use one locked visitor and detached location
values (`aggregateProviderLocations` in `coordinator/api/stats_provider_locations.go`),
so a new or replacement connection cannot change the geography between the row
and count observations. Missing
or stale verification metadata is counted as unknown in the UI, with a separate
known-verdict denominator. Owner views retain explicit `app_attest_authorized`
and expiry guidance during older-coordinator rollout without inventing missing
proof timestamps; connected untrusted records remain in the connected count.
`verification_counts` in stats and privacy-floored provider geography buckets
contains `connections`, `authorized` (union), `app_attest`, `legacy`, and
`overlap`. Both method counts include the overlap. Legacy `hardware_attested`
counts remain evidence counts. Top-level counts additionally report
`known_unique_machines`, `connections_without_machine_identity`,
`reported_macos_27_or_later`, and `connections_with_reported_os`. Known machines
are deduplicated privately from verified account/machine inventory; this is not
proof of physical uniqueness. OS counts are app reports, not successful App
Attest counts. Private-only providers are excluded. These aggregates describe
the source snapshot, not a reusable routing grant. Code:
`coordinator/api/stats_verification.go` (`addProvider`).

Live console views honor each method's expiry and stop showing cached verified
verdicts after 60 seconds from `observed_at`, even if polling fails. Revocation
appears on refresh, subject to server/cache/poll delay; no instant push is
promised. Chat history uses dispatch time instead of the live clock. No
telemetry wire enums or authorization gates change.


## App Attest authorization additions

| Surface | Contract | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/admin/app-attest/revoke` | Admin authenticated; account/key/reason body, durable idempotent revocation and immediate local dispatch fencing; [exact response and errors](provider-authorization.md#admin-revocation) | `coordinator/api/app_attest_revocation.go` (`handleAdminAppAttestRevoke`) |
| `GET /v1/providers/attestation` | Public connections only; private-only providers are excluded before shared caching. Additive `app_attest_authorized` boolean and `authorization_expires_at` Unix deadline; no account, App Attest credential, canonical machine IDs or raw evidence exposed. The existing persistent legacy `se_public_key` remains linkable across public sessions. | `coordinator/api/provider.go` (`handleProviderAttestation`) |

`GET /v1/me/providers` adds account-scoped `app_attest_authorized` and optional
`authorization_expires_at` (exclusive Unix seconds), computed from the current
connection's complete registry authorization; stored/offline records never
restore that grant. These fields add no private App Attest IDs or proof bytes
and never change legacy `trust_level` or `mda_verified`. Code:
`coordinator/api/me_authorization.go` (`attachMyProviderAuthorization`).

Each owner-visible provider may also include `os_version`, the current or last
app-reported macOS version retained from its signed registration blob in
`attestation.VerificationResult.OSVersion`. This is upgrade guidance, not
Apple-certified inventory or serving authorization. A live connection without
an OS report clears any older stored version; absent values mean unknown.
Code: `coordinator/api/me_handlers.go` (`buildMyProvider`).

## Conventions used in the route tables

**Auth column** — how the handler chain establishes identity. The only credential header is `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (`extractBearerToken`); the coordinator never reads `x-api-key`.

| Label | Mechanism | Symbol |
|---|---|---|
| `—` | No authentication | — |
| `key` | Bearer is an API key ([shape](#api-key-shapes); legacy `eigeninference-…` keys are also accepted), a Privy JWT, or the admin key. Missing or invalid → 401 `authentication_error` | `requireAuth` |
| `privy` | Bearer must be a Privy JWT. API keys → 403 `forbidden` | `requirePrivyAuth` |
| `user` | `key` or `privy` plus an in-handler check that a resolved account user is in the context (Privy JWT, or an API key linked to a Privy account). Admin key and unlinked legacy keys → 401 `auth_error` | `requirePrivyUser` (`coordinator/api/billing_handlers.go`) |
| `admin` | In-handler check: Bearer equals the admin key (`EIGENINFERENCE_ADMIN_KEY`), or the context holds a Privy user whose email is in the admin list. Otherwise 403 `forbidden`. When the route is registered *without* `requireAuth` no user is ever placed in the context, so only the admin key can pass; those rows say `admin-key` | `isAdminAuthorized` (`coordinator/api/release_handlers.go`), `requireAdminKey` (`coordinator/api/invite_handlers.go`), `isAdmin` (`coordinator/api/billing_handlers.go`) |
| `admin-session` | `requireAuth` verifies the Privy JWT or admin key; the handler requires an allowlisted admin and rejects inference API keys/provider tokens even when owned by an admin. Missing/invalid credentials → 401; authenticated non-admin or non-interactive account credentials → 403 | `isBuildAdminAuthorized` (`coordinator/api/app_attest_builds.go`) |
| `publishing` | `X-Darkbloom-Publishing-Key` header or Bearer equal to the bootstrap `MODEL_REGISTRY_PUBLISHING_KEY`, the admin key, or a publishing key stored in the DB | `requirePublishingAPIKey` (`coordinator/api/model_registry_handlers.go`) |
| `release` | Bearer equal to `EIGENINFERENCE_RELEASE_KEY`; otherwise 401 `unauthorized` | `handleRegisterRelease` (`coordinator/api/release_handlers.go`) |
| `stripe-sig` | Stripe webhook signature | `handleStripeWebhook` (`coordinator/api/billing_handlers.go`), `handleStripeConnectWebhook` (`coordinator/api/stripe_payouts_webhooks.go`) |
| `mdm-secret` | Webhook secret via `X-Webhook-Token` header or `?token=`; body capped at [`maxMDMWebhookBodyBytes`](#limits-and-validation) | `HandleMDMWebhook` |
| `ws` | Provider WebSocket handshake (enrollment credentials + attestation); see [`protocol-messages.md`](protocol-messages.md) | `handleProviderWS` (`coordinator/api/provider.go`) |

**Limiter column** — the rate-limit middleware in the chain. All limiters share one implementation, `rateLimitWithTier`, keyed by the authenticated account id (`consumerKeyFromContext`); the admin key bypasses it.

| Label | Behaviour | Symbol |
|---|---|---|
| `drain` | While draining, new inference requests get **429** `rate_limit_exceeded` with `Retry-After` set to [`coordinatorDrainRetryAfter`](#timeouts-and-constants) (written through `writeTokenRateLimited`) | `drainGate` (`coordinator/api/drain.go`) |
| `rpm` | Consumer tier: first the key's own `rpm_limit` (`applyKeyRPMLimit`), then the account limiter; service-role accounts use the elevated service limiter. Rejection → 429 `rate_limit_exceeded` (`code: rate_limit_exceeded`) with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` | `rateLimitConsumer` |
| `fin` | Financial tier: the stricter limiter installed by `SetFinancialRateLimiter`, applied to every account regardless of role; same 429 shape | `rateLimitFinancial` |

Both tiers set `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`, `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`, `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` on allowed *and* rejected responses (`setRequestRateLimitHeaders`). Limiter `Retry-After` values are clamped to `[DefaultRetryAfter, maxRetryAfter]` ([Timeouts and constants](#timeouts-and-constants)).

## Routes

### Inference (4)

All four share the chain `drainGate → requireAuth → rateLimitConsumer → sealedTransport → handler` and the pipeline in `coordinator/api/consumer.go`.

After authentication, shared preprocessing rejects negative or malformed
top-level `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens` and `max_output_tokens` with
HTTP400 `invalid_request_error` naming the field, before budget defaulting or
inference admission (`invalidOutputTokenField`,
`coordinator/api/output_budget_validation.go`). Omitted, null and zero retain
their existing default-bound behavior; valid positive integer bounds and alias
precedence are unchanged. Nested tool arguments and schemas are not inspected
as inference budgets.

| Method | Path | Handler | Auth | Limiter | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | `handleChatCompletions` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`) | `key` | `drain`, `rpm`, token limits | OpenAI Chat Completions, streaming and non-streaming |
| POST | `/v1/responses` | `handleChatCompletions` — the same handler; it detects `input` (Responses) versus `messages` (Chat) | `key` | same | OpenAI Responses; lowered by `coordinator/promptcontract/endpoint_lower_responses.go`, streamed by `newResponsesStreamEmitter` (`coordinator/api/responses_stream.go`) |
| POST | `/v1/completions` | `handleCompletions` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`) | `key` | same | Legacy text completions; response built by `coordinator/api/generic_endpoint_response.go`, streamed by `newGenericEndpointStreamEmitter` (`coordinator/api/generic_endpoint_stream.go`) |

### Models and catalog (9)

| Method | Path | Handler | Auth | Limiter | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/v1/models` | `handleListModels` (`coordinator/api/models_endpoints.go`) | `key` | — | `ModelListResponse`: public aliases plus un-aliased builds (`?include_builds=1` also lists hidden builds). With `X-Darkbloom-Route: self` or a `self_route_only` key it returns the account's own machines' models filtered by the key's `allowed_models`. Field reference in [`../consumer/models.md`](../consumer/models.md) |

### Authentication and API keys (10)

| Method | Path | Handler | Auth | Limiter | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/v1/auth/keys` | `handleCreateKey` (`coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) | `privy` | `fin` | Legacy mint: `CreateKeyResponse` `{api_key, account_id}`. If every active (not disabled, not expired) key on the account is already `self_route_only`, the minted key inherits that ceiling (`consoleKeyInheritsSelfRouteOnly`) so console auto-provision cannot escalate a machine-only account onto the paid public fleet |
| DELETE | `/v1/auth/keys` | `handleRevokeKey` (`coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) | `privy` | — | Body `{"key": "<api key>"}`; 400 `bad_request` otherwise; `RevokeKeyResponse` `{status}` |
| GET | `/v1/keys` | `handleListAPIKeys` (`coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) | `privy` | — | `APIKeyListResponse` `{object: "list", data: [APIKeyResponse]}` |
| POST | `/v1/keys` | `handleCreateAPIKey` (`coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) | `privy` | `fin` | `CreateAPIKeyResponse` `{key, data}`; `key` is the plaintext secret ([API key shapes](#api-key-shapes)) |
| GET | `/v1/keys/{id}` | `handleGetAPIKey` (`coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) | `privy` | — | `APIKeyResponse` |
| PATCH | `/v1/keys/{id}` | `handleUpdateAPIKey` (`coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) | `privy` | `fin` | Partial update, fields under [API key shapes](#api-key-shapes) |
| DELETE | `/v1/keys/{id}` | `handleDeleteAPIKey` (`coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) | `privy` | `fin` | Revoke |

Lifecycle semantics: [`../consumer/authentication.md`](../consumer/authentication.md).

### Device-code flow (3)

| Method | Path | Handler | Auth | Limiter | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/v1/device/code` | `handleDeviceCode` (`coordinator/api/device_auth.go`) | `—` | — | 200 `{device_code, user_code, verification_uri, expires_in, interval}` |
| POST | `/v1/device/token` | `handleDeviceToken` (`coordinator/api/device_auth.go`) | `—` | — | Body `{"device_code"}` (400 `invalid_request` if missing). 200 `{status: "authorization_pending"}` until approved; 200 `{status: "authorized", token, account_id}` once approved; 404 `invalid_grant`; 410 `expired_token` |
| POST | `/v1/device/approve` | `handleDeviceApprove` (`coordinator/api/device_auth.go`) | `privy` | `fin` | Body `{"user_code"}`. 404 `invalid_code`, 409 `already_used`, 410 `expired_code` |

Constants: `DeviceCodeExpiry` = 15 min (`expires_in: 900`), `DeviceCodePollInterval` = 5 (`interval`). The `token` is a **provider token** (`eigeninference-pt-` + 64 hex characters, labelled `device-<user_code>`; only its SHA-256 hash is stored) used by the provider CLI to link a machine to the account; it is not a consumer API key. The small-body cap [`maxControlPlaneBodyBytes`](#limits-and-validation) applies to these unauthenticated endpoints.

### Account, balance, usage and pricing (15)

| Method | Path | Handler | Auth | Limiter | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/v1/payments/balance` | `handleBalance` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`) | `key` | — | `BalanceResponse` `{balance_micro_usd, balance_usd, withdrawable_micro_usd, withdrawable_usd}` |
| GET | `/v1/payments/usage` | `handleUsage` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`) | `key` | — | `UsageResponse` `{usage: [...]}`; each `payments.UsageEntry` carries `cached_tokens` (omitted when 0) — the subset of `prompt_tokens` billed at the cache-read rate; recent history only ([retention](pricing-model.md#constants)) |

| GET | `/v1/pricing` | `handleGetPricing` (`coordinator/api/billing_handlers.go`) | `—` | — | Public price table, `types.PricingResponse` `{prices: [{model, input_price, output_price, cache_read_price, input_usd, output_usd, cache_read_usd}], fallback_input_price, fallback_output_price, fallback_cache_read_price, fallback_*_usd}`; `cache_read_price` is the effective rate (derived when the row sets none); see [`pricing-model.md`](pricing-model.md) |
| PUT | `/v1/pricing` | `handleSetPricing` (`coordinator/api/billing_handlers.go`) | `user` | — | Provider sets its own prices: `{model, input_price, output_price, cache_read_price?}` (`modelPriceInput`, `coordinator/api/model_pricing.go`; `0 ≤ cache_read_price ≤ input_price`, omitted = derived) → `types.PriceUpdateResponse` |
| DELETE | `/v1/pricing` | `handleDeletePricing` (`coordinator/api/billing_handlers.go`) | `user` | — | Revert to defaults |

All six `/v1/me/*` routes are wrapped in `requirePrivyAuth`, so they are Privy-JWT only.

### Stripe, payouts and MDM (13)

| Method | Path | Handler | Auth | Limiter | Notes |

### Public stats and health (6)

| Method | Path | Handler | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/v1/stats` | `handleStats` (`coordinator/api/stats.go`) | `—` | Refresh every 30 s; preserve the UTC source observation time in `snapshot_at` (`time.RFC3339Nano`). Geography refreshes independently and reports availability per section. Retain a successful core body up to 5 min on core refresh failure; 503 `service_unavailable` without an unexpired success |
| GET | `/v1/leaderboard` | `handleLeaderboard` (`coordinator/api/leaderboard.go`) | `—` | Cached 5 min (full) / 1 min (recent window) |
| GET | `/v1/network/totals` | `handleNetworkTotals` (`coordinator/api/network_totals.go`) | `—` | Totals refreshed every minute with the same 5 min safety TTL; 503 `service_unavailable` without an unexpired success; canonical windows `24h`, `7d`, `30d`, `all` (`1d` → `24h`, empty/`lifetime` → `all`) |
| GET | `/v1/network/model-demand` | `handleModelDemand` (`coordinator/api/model_demand.go`) | `—` | Recorded public model demand; `window=24h` (default), `7d`, `30d`; cached up to 5 min; 400 for other windows; 503 on unavailable aggregation |
| GET | `/v1/network/series` | `handleNetworkSeries` (`coordinator/api/network_series.go`) | `—` | Time series, cached 1 min; 503 `service_unavailable` on a store error after a miss, with no failed result cached |
| GET | `/health` | `handleHealth` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`) | `—` | `HealthResponse` `{status: "ok", draining, providers, version, build_commit, build_date}` |

A successful empty analytics window returns 200 with empty arrays or zero totals.
Core stats query failures retain the unexpired success or return 503; request
geography never blocks core stats. Geography refreshes on its own
`statsRefreshInterval` loop, using `statsGeographyCacheKey`. Core snapshots
include the latest completed geography attempt, so availability changes appear
on a subsequent core refresh. Missing or expired geography is unavailable.
Cache behavior is implemented by `coordinator/api/cache_refresher.go`
(`computeCachedEntry`, `StartCacheRefreshers`) and
`coordinator/api/stats_geography.go` (`cachedStatsGeography`, `computeStatsGeography`).

| Stats geography field | Contract | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `request_locations_status`, `request_flows_status` | `available` or `unavailable`, independently; unavailable includes startup before the first geography refresh finishes. Core stats still return 200 | `coordinator/api/stats_geography.go` (`statsGeographyStatus`, `computeStatsGeography`) |
| `geography_snapshot_at` | RFC 3339 UTC observation start for the geography attempt, separate from core `snapshot_at`; empty before an attempt or after expiry | `coordinator/api/stats_geography.go` (`statsGeography`) |
| `request_locations`, `request_regions`, `unknown_request_location_requests`, `suppressed_request_city_requests` | `null` when locations are unavailable; successful empty windows retain arrays and numeric counts. A failed attempt replaces previous geography rather than presenting stale figures as current | `coordinator/api/stats_geography.go` (`computeStatsGeography`, `addTo`) |
| `request_flows` | `null` when flows are unavailable, an array (possibly empty) on success; independent of location status | `coordinator/api/stats_geography.go` (`computeStatsGeography`) |
| `provider_locations`, `provider_regions` | Computed from the same live-fleet walk as core provider rows and verification counts; request-geography failures do not hide provider geography | `coordinator/api/stats.go` (`computeStats`); `coordinator/api/stats_provider_locations.go` (`aggregateProviderLocations`) |

The stats, totals, and series handlers emit the 503 `service_unavailable` error
envelope when their required data is unavailable.

### Model demand response

`coordinator/api/model_demand.go` (`handleModelDemand`) serves a fixed receipt-time
window ending at the preceding UTC hour (at least one hour behind now). The
JSON has `window`, `start_at`, `end_at`, `updated_at`, `collection_started_at`,
`coverage: "published_hourly_cohorts"`, `bucket_seconds`, and `models`. Each model object has `model`,
`requests`, `completed`, `capacity_rejected`, `latency_rejected`, `timed_out`,
`failed`, `cancelled`, `unknown`, and `http_429` (all counts are integers).
Each model also contains `time_series`: fixed display intervals with `timestamp`
and `counts` (the same outcome counters, or `null` when no hours are publishable).
Intervals are 1 hour for `24h`, 6 hours for `7d`, and 24 hours for `30d`.
Publication eligibility is always evaluated per model and UTC clock hour:
at least 20 non-excluded recorded requests from 3 consumer accounts. Larger
display intervals sum only eligible hours and may cover only part of their
duration. They never restore suppressed hours. Each model's totals equal the
fieldwise sum of its non-null interval counts; no complete-window totals or
suppressed residuals are exposed. Models without an eligible hour are omitted.
Null intervals are gaps, not measured zeros. All counts share one repeatable-read
transaction and the same hourly publication rule across all three windows.

The seven outcome counts sum to `requests`; `http_429` overlaps that partition.
`capacity_rejected` includes provider or coordinator saturation and a 503
`model_too_large` supply shortfall. A preflight `context_exceeded` request is
excluded from `requests`; `dispatch_exhausted` is counted as capacity only when
the terminal capacity check supports its HTTP 429 response. Other 429 reasons
are not assumed to be capacity rejections.
No token estimates, identifiers, provider details, raw reasons, or suppressed
counts are exposed. `ModelDemandCounts` in `coordinator/store/model_demand.go`
is the response shape.

Only new, explicitly scoped requests reaching public routing admission are
counted. Owner-preferred, exclusive self-route and machine-restricted requests
are excluded; validation and account failures are outside the denominator.
Requests rejected before this point (including early model shedding) are not
covered. Admin-key traffic is excluded. Ordinary authenticated load tests cannot be separated from organic
traffic. Public aliases retain their requested identity through build fallback.
Client retries count separately; internal dispatch attempts do not.

`ModelDemandMinRequests = 20` and `ModelDemandMinConsumers = 3` suppress sparse
hourly model cohorts. A gateway is one authenticated consumer, not a count of
its downstream users. A successful empty list means no hour qualifies for
publication, not zero traffic. Counts and percentages describe published hours
only, not the complete selected window. Collection may also have partial history;
recording remains best-effort, not an independently reconciled network-wide
denominator. Completion establishes
coordinator-observed provider completion and successful terminal writes, not
client receipt. See [incoming request accounting](../architecture/request-accounting.md).


### Release and install (5)

| Method | Path | Handler | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/install.sh` | inline closure in `routes()` rendering `installScript` with the coordinator URL from `resolveBaseURL` | `—` | Provider install script, `text/plain` |
| GET | `/api/version` | `handleVersion` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`) | `—` | `VersionResponse` `{version, platform, backend, download_url, binary_hash, bundle_hash, metallib_hash, changelog}`; uses the newest active release in the store, else `LatestProviderVersion` |
| POST | `/v1/releases` | `handleRegisterRelease` (`coordinator/api/release_handlers.go`) | `release` | Register a release |
| GET | `/v1/releases/latest` | `handleLatestRelease` (`coordinator/api/release_handlers.go`) | `—` | Latest release record |
| GET | `/readyz` | `handleReadyz` (`coordinator/api/drain.go`) | `—` | 200 normally; 503 while draining |

The 0.9.12 candidate sets `LatestProviderVersion = "0.9.12"` in
`coordinator/api/server.go`. A registered active release still takes precedence
for version displays; this fallback change does not publish an updater release.
`GET /v1/releases/latest` requires a registered release and returns 404 when none
exists (`coordinator/api/release_handlers.go`, `handleLatestRelease`).

`POST /v1/releases` accepts additive `code_directory_hash`, `source_commit`, `ci_run_id`, and `require_app_attest_qualification`. The production workflow requires durable approval; enabled production App Attest serving also enforces the gate server-side. The scoped release key cannot create approval. Missing or conflicting approval returns 409 without advancing latest; unavailable qualification returns 503. Both the legacy version path and a bundle-hash-qualified `releases/v<VERSION>/artifacts/<BUNDLE_SHA256>/darkbloom-bundle-<PLATFORM>.tar.gz` path are accepted only on the configured R2 origin. Code: `coordinator/api/app_attest_publication.go` (`persistReleaseForPublication`), `coordinator/api/release_handlers.go` (`trustedReleaseArtifactURL`).

Admin `GET/POST /v1/admin/app-attest/builds` lists/approves signed builds; admin `POST /v1/admin/app-attest/builds/revoke` records a permanent withdrawal. See [request/response and error contracts](provider-authorization.md#durable-build-qualification). With production App Attest serving enabled, even cached `/v1/releases/latest` and `/api/version` responses return 503 when the selected release lacks fresh qualification/catalog readiness; this does not silently select a different release.

Release publishing: [`../operations/provider-release.md`](../operations/provider-release.md).

### Catch-all (1)

| Pattern | Handler | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/` | `handleUnimplementedEndpoint` | Any `/v1/*` request matching no registered method+path — including a wrong method on a real path — gets 404 `invalid_request_error` with message `endpoint <METHOD> <path> is not implemented` |

Total: 4 + 9 + 10 + 3 + 15 + 13 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 41 + 1 = **117 registrations**, matching `routes()`.


## Exact cache status

`GET /v1/cache/status` returns aggregate operational state, with no provider,
model, tenant, prompt, token, hash, scope, or epoch identifiers
(`ExactCacheStatus`, `coordinator/api/exact_cache_status.go`). Readiness counts
are advertised provider/model pairs, not unique models or guaranteed cache hits.

| JSON field | Meaning | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `artifact_allowlist.configured` | Whether the optional exact-artifact list is configured; `false` is unrestricted, `true` plus zero count denies all participation | `coordinator/api/exact_cache_status.go` (`ExactCacheArtifactAllowlistStatus`) |
| `artifact_allowlist.count` | Number of configured exact tuples; never returns their model IDs or hashes | Same |
| `providers.v2_ready_models` | Ready durable SSD capabilities; preserves the existing meaning | `coordinator/registry/cache_status.go` (`PrefixCacheProtocolStatus`) |
| `providers.memory_ready_models` | Ready resident capabilities, counted separately from SSD readiness | `coordinator/registry/cache_status.go` (`PrefixCacheProtocolStatus`) |
| `lifecycle.fences_applied` | Proof-fence windows opened or escalated | `coordinator/registry/cache_routing.go` (`CacheRoutingLifecycleStatus`); `coordinator/registry/cache_proof_fence.go` (`rejectCapability`) |
| `lifecycle.fences_expired` | Windows that lifted by time, each counted once | Same; `coordinator/registry/cache_proof_fence.go` (`countLapseLocked`) |
| `lifecycle.fenced_capabilities` | Currently fenced provider/model/tier capabilities | Same; `coordinator/registry/cache_proof_fence.go` (`sweepFencesLocked`) |
| `lifecycle.demand_entries` | Entries currently in the observed-demand index | `coordinator/registry/cache_demand.go` (`stats`) |
| `lifecycle.demand_cap_evictions` | Demand entries evicted by the cap inside their TTL; a growing count means repeated prefixes are being reported as novel | Same |

The artifact-list fields have Prometheus gauges
`exact_cache_artifact_allowlist_configured`, `exact_cache_artifact_allowlist_count`
and Datadog gauges `exact_cache.artifact_allowlist.configured`,
`exact_cache.artifact_allowlist.count`; mode `off` remains authoritative
(`coordinator/api/exact_cache_metrics.go`).

The additive resident count has Prometheus gauge
`exact_cache_memory_ready_models` and Datadog gauge
`exact_cache.memory_ready_models` (`coordinator/api/exact_cache_metrics.go`).
The fence fields have Prometheus gauges `exact_cache_fence{event}`
(`event` ∈ `applied`, `expired`) and `exact_cache_fenced_capabilities`, and
Datadog gauges `exact_cache.fence` tagged `event:applied|expired` and
`exact_cache.fenced_capabilities` (same file).
The existing `prefix_cache_statuses` state/reason aggregates retain their SSD
meaning; resident routing uses the separate memory capability and bounded holder
receipts described in [cache-aware routing](../architecture/cache-aware-routing.md).

The exact-cache lifecycle `holder_removed` map includes `proof_mismatch`, separate
from `capability_change`, and `shorter_hit`, separate from `miss_invalidation`: a
provider that proves a hit below a boundary it was recorded at loses its deeper
holders for that prompt in that tier, without a fence. `proof_mismatch` counts plan-scoped drops (anchor
mismatches, `invalidateProviderPlan`) and whole provider/model drops (identity
mismatches, `invalidateProviderModel`); the fence windows themselves are
defined in [cache-aware routing](../architecture/cache-aware-routing.md#protocol-v2-proof).
Updating one model preserves unchanged models' holders,
pending receipts and proof fences. See `coordinator/registry/cache_model_changes.go`
and `coordinator/registry/cache_receipt_result.go`.

Per-model cache usage, accepted lookup and selection metrics are available only
through the existing authenticated `GET /v1/admin/metrics` endpoint and Datadog.
They add no model identifiers or fields to `GET /v1/cache/status`. See the
[internal cache metric inventory](telemetry-inventory.md#cache-results-by-model-internal)
for `cache_model_*` labels and populations (`coordinator/api/cache_model_telemetry.go`).

## Provider operational metrics

`GET /v1/me/providers` returns a `reputation` object on each machine with
`total_jobs`, `successful_jobs`, `failed_jobs`, `total_uptime_seconds`,
`avg_response_time_ms`, `challenges_passed`, and `challenges_failed`
(`coordinator/api/me_handlers.go`, `myReputation`). The legacy object name is
retained for the raw metrics; its former `score` field has been removed.
Live and stored/offline snapshots have the same shape. The console displays
job counts, tokens, uptime, and response timing without a reputation rating.

Deploy the updated console before the coordinator field removal: older console
bundles dereference `reputation.score` and cannot consume the new response.
Existing tabs running an older bundle must reload. The updated console also
accepts older responses containing the extra field.

## First-content routing and retry behavior

Inference planning may obtain exact input work from the verified model/template
tokenizer before dispatch. The internal numeric provenance is not a client
request field. Planning, retries and provider reconciliation spend the same
original first-content clock; neither corrected counts nor a calibrated margin
extend it. Unsupported shapes keep conservative fallback, and billing continues
to settle actual provider usage (`planPromptRoute`, `coordinator/api/prompt_work.go`).

Public inference uses [first-content routing](../architecture/first-content-routing.md)
by default across chat completions, Responses, completions and Anthropic messages.
Internal retries, cache planning, quotes, queue waits and hedges consume the same
original request deadline. Predictive provider refusals do not count as node
health failures; after two, another attempt needs fresh feasible evidence.
A request can launch at most one speculative backup. Current error JSON and
`Retry-After` contracts remain; unavailable deadline-bound capacity can produce
an earlier overload response instead of waiting the queue maximum. Explicit
owner routing, deadline exemptions and valid empty completions keep their
existing contracts (`coordinator/api/first_content_retry.go`,
`coordinator/api/first_content_preflight.go`).

## Provider capacity observations

`GET /v1/me/providers` exposes the accepted backend slot snapshot through
`backend_capacity.slots` (`handleMyProviders`, `coordinator/api/me_handlers.go`). The
owner-only response also carries optional `backend_capacity.load_usable_gb`
(live no-eviction load memory before serving headroom),
`backend_capacity.load_headroom_gb` (activation plus minimum-KV reserve for
the current serving set), each model's `estimated_memory_gb`, and
`capacity_model_ids`: the catalog/capability-accepted subset to which the
canonicalized heartbeat slots and memory sample apply. The response also carries
`capacity_accepted_at`, the coordinator time of the last applied capacity
snapshot. A repeated or out-of-order capacity sequence can advance
`last_heartbeat` for liveness without refreshing this timestamp. The owner
load verdict uses `capacity_accepted_at` and withholds stale or absent samples.
`models_replace` clears this owner load evidence until an accepted heartbeat
for the replacement inventory arrives, including when a model ID is reused.
It also carries optional `backend_capacity.load_transition_active`, which marks
an in-flight model load or load-gate update before a slot exists. The provider
emits a capacity heartbeat when this transition changes. My Macs and the
coordinator attention count defer memory failures while it is active.
My Macs shows `estimated_memory_gb + load_headroom_gb` against `load_usable_gb` for
cold accepted models. A crashed slot retains weights and gets a separate
backend warning, not a cold-load verdict. Owner-only/off-catalog models remain
in `models` but are not assigned a load verdict from a different canonical inventory.
Missing fields from older providers mean unknown, never zero or
"fits"; a stale capacity sample, active or queued request, in-flight load or
reloading slot also withholds a definitive cold-load failure. The coordinator does not route
from these owner diagnostics.
The existing `free_for_load_gb` remains the routing input and may credit
eviction of idle slots, so it is not interchangeable with the no-eviction
preload budget. The
optional `paged_storage` object carries bounded allocator observations; omitted
fields mean uninstrumented. Its exact fields and sample-age rules live in the
[wire reference](protocol-messages.md#slotspaged_storage). The coordinator
consumer is implemented; provider emission is pending. These observations do
not grant admission or assert cache readiness.

## Provider-bound request normalization

`_darkbloom_prompt_date` is reserved internal body context. The coordinator
overwrites caller input once with the request's UTC Gregorian `YYYY-MM-DD`
before lowering, cache planning, fallback and retries (`parseInferencePrelude`,
`coordinator/api/inference_preprocess.go`; `SetRequestDate`,
`coordinator/promptcontract/request_date.go`). Local provider HTTP captures its
own date; callers cannot override it (`LocalChatRequest`,
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Server/LocalChatRequest.swift`). It is not a
new envelope or canonical signature field. The renderer semantic version and
contract behavior are defined in [prompt-contract sidecar](../architecture/prompt-contract-sidecar.md).

## Headers

### Read by the coordinator

| Header | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | `extractBearerToken` | The only credential header; scheme match is case-insensitive |
| `X-Request-ID` | `loggingMiddleware` | Honoured if present, otherwise generated (`newRequestID`); echoed back and logged, never persisted |
| `Content-Type: application/eigeninference-sealed+json` | `sealedTransport` (`coordinator/api/sender_encryption.go`) | Switches the inference endpoint into sealed mode (`SealedContentType`) |
| `X-Darkbloom-Metadata-Details` | `applyMetadataDetailsRequest` (`coordinator/api/response_metadata.go`) | Requests the extended `metadata` object (`timing`, `location`) on chat completions; `?metadata=details` does the same |
| `X-Darkbloom-Route: self` / `prefer` | `resolveSelfRoutePolicy` (`coordinator/api/self_route.go`) | `self` restricts dispatch to the account's own machines; `prefer` tries them first and falls back to the fleet; see [`../provider/self-route.md`](../provider/self-route.md) |
| `X-Darkbloom-Publishing-Key` | `requirePublishingAPIKey` | Publishing credential for `/v1/admin/models/*` |
| `Stripe-Signature` | `handleStripeWebhook`, `handleStripeConnectWebhook` | Stripe webhook signature |
| `X-Webhook-Token` | `HandleMDMWebhook` | MDM webhook secret (or `?token=`) |
| `Origin` | `corsMiddleware` | Allowed origins default to `https://console.darkbloom.dev` plus localhost dev ports unless `EIGENINFERENCE_CONSOLE_URL` overrides |

### Set by the coordinator

| Header | Where | When |
|---|---|---|

| `Retry-After` | `rateLimitWithTier`, `applyKeyRPMLimit`, `writeTokenRateLimited`, `drainGate`, `shedIfModelRejected`, `writeTTFTTooSlow`, `writeServiceUnavailable`, `runInferenceAdmission`, `selfRouteUnavailable`, `preContentTerminal`, the exhausted branch of `dispatchState.run` (`coordinator/api/dispatch.go`) | Every 429 (including the drain 429, [`coordinatorDrainRetryAfter`](#timeouts-and-constants)); 503 `service_unavailable`, `machine_offline` (30 s), `model_not_loaded` (15 s), and 503 `provider_error` from dispatch exhaustion. **Not** set on 503 `model_unavailable`, 502, or 504. Admission values come from `estimateRetryAfter` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`), capped at [`maxDistressRetryAfter`](#timeouts-and-constants); a provider-forecast `feasible_after_ms` overrides it, clamped to 2–30 s |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`, `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`, `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` | `rateLimitWithTier`, `setRequestRateLimitHeaders` | Request-rate limited routes (`rpm`, `fin`); the first only on rejection |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-input-tokens`, `x-ratelimit-remaining-input-tokens`, `x-ratelimit-reset-input-tokens`, and the `-output-tokens` triple | `setTokenRateLimitHeaders` | Inference responses when token limits are configured |
| `X-Timing` | `writeTimingHeaderWithProfile` (`coordinator/api/profiler_dispatch.go`) | Committed inference responses.

| `X-Inference-Job-ID` | `writeInferenceJobIDHeader` (`coordinator/api/sse_response.go`) | Committed inference responses; the coordinator job id, which can differ from `X-Request-ID` across retries |

| `X-Attestation-Se-Public-Key` | `writeCommittedProviderHeaders` | When the provider attested with a Secure Enclave key; see [`../consumer/verification.md`](../consumer/verification.md) |
| `X-Eigen-Sealed: true`, `X-Eigen-Sealed-Kid` | `sealingResponseWriter` (`coordinator/api/sender_encryption.go`) | Sealed-mode responses |

## Error envelope and status codes

Every error body has one shape (`errorResponse`, `writeJSON`, `withCode` in `coordinator/api/httputil.go`):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "human-readable text",
    "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "param": "model"
  }
}
```

`code` mirrors `type` unless a handler overrides it (`withCode`, e.g. `payload_too_large`, `model_capability_unsupported`); `param` is present only when a handler names the offending field (`withParam`, e.g. `"model"` on `model_not_found`). Chat errors raised *after* a stream has committed cannot change the status line; they surface as a terminal SSE `error` event, without a normal-completion `[DONE]` (`writeChatStreamTerminalError`, `coordinator/api/chat_metadata_stream.go`; `writeChatStreamProviderError`, `coordinator/api/consumer_stream.go`).

| Status | `type` values | Raised by |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_request_error`, `invalid_sealed_envelope`, `kid_mismatch`, `decryption_failed`, `invalid_request`, `bad_request`, `referral_error` | Body/JSON validation, `n > 1`, tool-choice and vision rules, native media tools unsupported by a model's serving fleet (`param: model`), sealed-envelope faults, device-code and key-management input, unknown catalog `?type=` |
| 401 | `authentication_error`, `auth_error`, `unauthorized` | Missing/invalid bearer (`requireAuth`, `requirePrivyAuth`), no account user (`requirePrivyUser`), release key |
| 402 | `insufficient_funds` (balance below the reservation), `insufficient_quota` (per-key spend cap); `code` is `insufficient_quota` for both | `reserveInferenceBalance` (`coordinator/api/inference_admission.go`); the per-cause table, including the provider-price 402, is [Payment-required responses](../architecture/billing.md#payment-required-responses) |
| 403 | `forbidden`, `model_not_allowed` | API key on a `privy` route; non-admin on an `admin` route; model outside the key's `allowed_models` (`keyModelAllowed`, `coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) |
| 404 | `model_not_found`, `not_found`, `invalid_grant`, `invalid_code`, `referral_error`, `invalid_request_error` | Model or alias not in the catalog; unknown key id; device codes; `/v1/` catch-all; state export when disabled |
| 409 | `no_linked_machine`, `already_used`, `conflict`, `stripe_account_gone`, `stripe_account_recreate_required` | Self-route without a linked machine; device-approve replay; invite-code collision; Stripe Connect state |
| 410 | `expired_token`, `expired_code` | expired [device codes](#device-code-flow-3) |
| 412 | `precondition_failed` | State export without an encryption recipient |
| 413 | `invalid_request_error` (plain, or with `code: payload_too_large`) | Inference body over `maxInferenceBodyBytes` ([Limits and validation](#limits-and-validation); `parseInferencePrelude`); admission rejects a prompt no provider can accept (`runInferenceAdmission`) |
| 422 | `invalid_request_error` | Tool-constraint schema the parser cannot compile (`validateResolvedToolConstraintParser`, `coordinator/api/tool_constraints.go`) |
| 426 | `upgrade_required` | Log report from a provider below the minimum version |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded`, `machine_busy` | `machine_busy`: self-route (`X-Darkbloom-Route: self`) when the owned machine is at capacity, with `Retry-After` (`preContentTerminal`, `coordinator/api/dispatch.go`). `rate_limit_exceeded`: key RPM, account RPM, input/output tokens per minute, coordinator drain (`Retry-After` = [`coordinatorDrainRetryAfter`](#timeouts-and-constants)), admission shedding, model-rejection shedding, fleet TTFT too slow, and dispatch exhausted on capacity: every attempt refused for capacity, no provider produced first content within the deadline (the coordinator's own pre-content timeout is reclassified from 504 by `classifyExhaustedStatus`, `coordinator/api/dispatch.go`), or the request fits no provider; always with `Retry-After` |
| 500 | `internal_error`, `server_error`, `auth_error`, `otp_error` | Store failures, token generation, account lookup, admin OTP delivery |
| 502 | `provider_error`, `stripe_error` | Provider returned an error or no usable output; Stripe API failures |
| 503 | `model_unavailable` (no `Retry-After`; may carry `code: model_capability_unsupported`), `service_unavailable`, `encryption_unavailable`, `machine_offline`, `model_not_loaded`, `billing_error`, `not_configured`, `provider_error` | No routable provider for the resolved model; no serving capacity (`writeServiceUnavailable`); sealing not configured; self-route machine states; ledger or Stripe not configured; Privy not configured for admin OTP; `/readyz` while draining; dispatch exhausted on a genuine provider 503; public stats/totals/series store failure with no usable cached body (see [public stats](#public-stats-and-health-5)) |
| 504 | `timeout`, `provider_error` | `timeout`: non-streaming only, `inferenceTimeout` elapsed after commit while waiting for the response or its usage. `provider_error`: dispatch exhausted on a **typed** provider 504 (`terminalCauseSafetyDeadline`, `terminalCauseBackpressureTimeout`; `isTypedTimeout504Cause`, `coordinator/api/terminal_cause.go`) |

When every dispatched provider rejects a request with the same deterministic client error (for example a chat template that cannot render the messages, or a body the provider caps), the provider's own 4xx status is passed through once as `invalid_request_error` with `code: model_capability` (or `payload_too_large`) rather than being retried or reclassified (`terminalClientError` handling in the exhausted branch of `dispatchState.run`, `coordinator/api/dispatch.go`).

A client that disconnects before commit receives nothing; the coordinator records status 499 internally and cancels the provider job (`sendProviderCancel`, `coordinator/api/consumer.go`).

## Inference request and response shapes

### Chat Completions request

Requests are decoded into a generic JSON object with `json.Number` preserved (`parseInferencePrelude`, `coordinator/api/inference_preprocess.go`), so fields the coordinator does not interpret pass through to the provider. Fields it does interpret:

| Field | Handling |
|---|---|
| `model` | Required. Alias or build id, resolved by `resolveRequestedModel` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`); see [`../consumer/models.md`](../consumer/models.md) |
| `messages` (Chat) / `input` (Responses) | Required; missing → 400 |
| `stream` | SSE when `true`; the provider's usage chunk, when it sends one, is held and emitted at the end of the stream |
| `n` | Values above 1 → 400 `invalid_request_error` |
| `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens` | `max_completion_tokens` is mapped to `max_tokens`. An explicit value is passed through unchanged (not clamped); when none is set the coordinator fills in the output bound from [pricing-model.md → Formulas](pricing-model.md#formulas) (`ensureMaxTokensBound`, `coordinator/api/consumer.go`) |
| `stop` | A single string is normalised to a one-element array in `parseInferencePrelude` |
| `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls` | Schemas normalised by `NormalizeToolSchemas` (`coordinator/api/toolschema.go`); constraints validated by `validateToolConstraintPolicy` (`coordinator/api/tool_constraints.go`) |
| `response_format` | Passed through to the provider without coordinator validation |
| `reasoning`, `reasoning_effort` | Applied per model policy by `applyResolvedModelReasoningPolicy` (`coordinator/api/reasoning_request_policy.go`) |
| `provider` and other routing hints | Removed by `stripProviderRoutingFields` (`coordinator/api/request_introspection.go`) |
| `image_url` parts with `http(s)` URLs | Fetched by the coordinator before dispatch (`resolveRemoteMedia`, `coordinator/api/media_resolve.go`) |

### Chat Completions response (`ChatCompletionResponse`, `coordinator/api/types/types.go`)

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-…",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1725000000,
  "model": "<the model string you sent>",
  "choices": [
    { "index": 0,
      "message": { "role": "assistant", "content": "…",
                   "reasoning": "…", "reasoning_content": "…", "reasoning_details": [ … ],
                   "tool_calls": [ … ] },
      "finish_reason": "stop" }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 12, "completion_tokens": 34, "total_tokens": 46,
    "prompt_tokens_details": { "cached_tokens": 0 },
    "completion_tokens_details": { "reasoning_tokens": 0 }
  },
  "se_signature": "…",
  "response_hash": "…",
  "metadata": { … }
}
```

In Chat streams, usage may accompany the finish event or arrive in a separate
usage-only event. Validated cache and reasoning details are added to the
combined event only when no separate usage event follows; otherwise the
dedicated event owns those details. No usage object is invented when the
provider sends none (`handleStreamingResponseWithFirstChunkAndError`,
`coordinator/api/consumer_stream.go`; `finalizeUsageChunk`,
`coordinator/api/chat_stream_terminal.go`).

`model` echoes the requested string, alias included (`buildNonStreamingResponse`, `coordinator/api/chat_response.go`). `se_signature` and `response_hash` are present when the provider signed the response; verification is described in [`../consumer/verification.md`](../consumer/verification.md). `metadata` is `ChatCompletionMetadata`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `provider_id` | string | Provider that served the request |
| `provider_attested` | bool | Attestation passed |
| `provider_trust_level` | string | Trust tier from attestation |
| `provider_encrypted` | bool | Coordinator→provider payload was end-to-end encrypted |
| `provider_chip`, `provider_machine_model`, `provider_secure_enclave`, `provider_mda_verified` | string / bool | Hardware facts from attestation |
| `attestation_se_public_key` | string | Secure Enclave public key used to sign |
| `job_id` | string | Coordinator job id (also `X-Inference-Job-ID`) |
| `timing` | `RequestTimingDetails` | Only with metadata details; the same fields as `X-Timing` |
| `location` | `ProviderApproxLocation` | Only with metadata details: `region`, `region_code`, `country`, `country_code`, `timezone` |

### Responses API

Non-empty string `instructions` becomes a leading system message before `input`,
preserving whitespace, existing system/developer messages and tool history.
Missing, null or empty instructions add no message; other types return400.
Both serving and text-cache preparation use `lowerResponsesWithContent`
(`coordinator/promptcontract/endpoint_lower_responses.go`); Rust mirrors the
text-cache contract in `lower_responses` (`coordinator/promptsidecar/src/endpoint.rs`).
Routing and billing reservation estimates include the new system message before
lowering (`routingShape`, `billingBytes`, `coordinator/api/request_introspection.go`).

Serving uses `LowerResponsesInferenceBody`
(`coordinator/promptcontract/endpoint_responses_inference.go`) to preserve
ordered inline media alongside text and function history. `input_image` accepts
a string `image_url`; canonical `image_url` and `video_url` parts accept their
`{"url": ...}` objects. These references must be inline `data:` URIs. Uploaded
file IDs, files, audio, unknown parts and the unsupported `input_video` alias
return400 rather than being omitted or fetched. The existing Chat remote-media
resolver policy is unchanged. Media-bearing `function_call_output.output`
arrays participate in vision routing and media-aware token estimates.

This serving path is distinct from `LowerProviderBody`, the text-only Go/Rust
cache-planning contract. That contract rejects media, including media in tool
outputs; accepting a Responses image for inference does not establish exact
coordinator cache-routing eligibility. Native model codec, media-size, context
and tool-capability checks still apply.

Bodies are lowered into the chat pipeline (`coordinator/promptcontract/endpoint_lower_responses.go`) and the provider's chat output is raised back into `ResponsesResponse` (`coordinator/api/types/types.go`): `id` (`resp_…`), `object`, `created_at`, `status`, `error`, `incomplete_details.reason`, `instructions`, `max_output_tokens`, `model`, `output[]`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `temperature`, `tool_choice`, `tools`, `top_p`, `metadata`, `usage` (`input_tokens`, `input_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`), `se_signature`, `response_hash`. Streams use `event:`-typed frames from `response.created` / `response.in_progress` through the item deltas to `response.completed` (or `response.incomplete` when truncated) and carry **no** `data: [DONE]` (`newResponsesStreamEmitter`, `coordinator/api/responses_stream.go`).

`usage.total_tokens` is always emitted as `input_tokens + output_tokens`, including
zero. Cached and reasoning token details are subsets, not additional tokens;
the same `buildResponsesUsage` constructor supplies direct, converted and
streamed responses (`coordinator/api/responses_response.go`). This field changes
neither the underlying usage counts nor billing.

Final non-streaming reasoning output items carry `status: completed`, matching
the streaming emitter's closed reasoning items (`appendResponsesOutputItems`,
`coordinator/api/responses_response.go`; `responsesStreamEmitter.closeReasoning`,
`coordinator/api/responses_stream.go`). This item status does not override a
root response marked `incomplete` because generation reached its output limit.

### Completions and Messages

`/v1/completions` and `/v1/messages` are lowered to the chat contract (`coordinator/promptcontract/endpoint_lower.go`, `coordinator/promptcontract/endpoint_lower_messages.go`); responses are re-shaped by `coordinator/api/generic_endpoint_response.go` and streams by `coordinator/api/generic_endpoint_stream.go`, which terminates with `data: [DONE]`. Usage reports a validated cache hit in each endpoint's own schema (`completionsUsage`, `messagesUsage`): `/v1/completions` adds `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` (a subset of `prompt_tokens`); `/v1/messages` reports `cache_read_input_tokens` and excludes those tokens from `input_tokens`, as Anthropic does. Streams carry the same object on their terminal event: the final `text_completion` chunk's `usage` for completions, and the `message_delta` `usage` for messages (its `message_start` still reports `input_tokens: 0`, because usage is known only at the end).

## SSE framing

Built by `handleStreamingResponseWithFirstChunkAndError` (`coordinator/api/consumer_stream.go`), `coordinator/api/sse_response.go`, and `coordinator/api/chat_metadata_stream.go`; ordering guarantees come from the dispatch state machine in `coordinator/api/dispatch.go`.

1. **Deferred commit.** No status line, headers, or bytes are written until the first *content* chunk arrives from a provider (`commitFirstContent`). Until then the coordinator can still fail over to another provider or return a JSON error with a real status code (`preContentTerminal`, `coordinator/api/dispatch_terminal_write.go`). Clients see a delayed 200, never a 200 that turns into an error mid-preamble.
2. **Headers at commit**: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Connection: keep-alive`, `X-Inference-Job-ID` (`writeSSEResponseHeader`), plus `X-Timing` and the `X-Provider-*` headers.
3. **Each provider chunk** is forwarded as one `data: <json>\n\n` event after `normalizeSSEChunk` (`coordinator/api/sse_normalize.go`); the coordinator does not re-tokenise or coalesce content. Chunks that arrive before commit are buffered (`chunkBufferSize` = 256).
4. **Usage and finish chunks are held.** A chunk that only carries `usage` (`parseUsageOnlyStreamChunk`) is held so the reasoning-token breakdown can be spliced in; the chunk carrying the terminal `finish_reason` (`parseFinishStreamChunk`) is held so it can be corrected to `length` against the authoritative token counts. Both are written after every content delta. `se_signature`, `response_hash` and opt-in `metadata` ride on the held usage chunk; when there is none they are emitted as one additional fully-shaped `chat.completion.chunk` (`newChatCompletionExtrasEvent`) immediately before termination. Every chunk's `model` is rewritten to the alias you sent (`rewriteChunkModel`).

   Coordinator-authored extras, including metadata before an in-band error,
   reuse the first observed Chat response `id` and its valid `created` timestamp
   (`chatStreamIdentity.observe`, `coordinator/api/chat_stream_identity.go`).
   Provider frames are not rewritten for this purpose; signature/hash values
   are preserved. The coordinator's job identity stays in `X-Inference-Job-ID`
   and `metadata.job_id`, not in a new response ID. If no valid provider ID has
   been observed, the existing `chatcmpl-<job-id>` fallback is used.
5. **Termination**: exactly one `data: [DONE]\n\n`, written by the coordinator after every coordinator-appended event. Any `[DONE]` from the provider is stripped first (`stripSSEDoneEvents`). Responses streams end with `response.completed` / `response.incomplete` instead.
6. **No keepalives.** The coordinator never writes comment frames or pings; a silent stream means the provider has not produced a token. Before commit a first-content deadline bounds the silence only for accounts selected by `EIGENINFERENCE_FIRST_CONTENT_SLA_ACCOUNTS` (a miss is answered with 429 + `Retry-After`, see the status table). Other accounts have no first-content timeout and remain subject to client cancellation and provider-disconnect cleanup; after commit `inferenceTimeout` bounds it (a terminal `error` event of type `timeout`).
7. **Chat errors after commit** are one terminal `data: {"error": {...}}` event, without `[DONE]`; optional authoritative metadata precedes it.
8. **Sealed mode** seals each SSE event individually (see below).

## Limits and validation

| Rule | Value / behaviour | Symbol |
|---|---|---|
| Global request body | 64 MiB ceiling on every request (`maxRequestBodyBytes`, `bodyLimitMiddleware`) | `coordinator/api/server.go` |
| Inference body | 16 MiB (`maxInferenceBodyBytes`) → 413 `invalid_request_error`; sealed bodies are read with the same cap (400 `invalid_request_error` when exceeded) | `parseInferencePrelude` (`coordinator/api/inference_preprocess.go`), `sealedTransport` (`coordinator/api/sender_encryption.go`) |
| Control-plane bodies | 64 KiB (`maxControlPlaneBodyBytes`) for enroll, device token, admin auth | `coordinator/api/server.go` |
| MDM webhook body | 1 MiB (`maxMDMWebhookBodyBytes`) | `HandleMDMWebhook` (`coordinator/api/server.go`) |
| `n` | Must be 1 | `handleChatCompletions` |
| `max_tokens` | `max_completion_tokens` → `max_tokens`; an explicit value is not clamped, a missing one is filled from the [output bound](pricing-model.md#formulas) | `ensureMaxTokensBound` |
| Prompt size at admission | 413 `payload_too_large` when the estimated prompt exceeds what the model's providers can accept | `runInferenceAdmission` (`coordinator/api/inference_admission.go`) |
| Catalog membership | Model resolved but absent from the routable catalog → 404 `model_not_found`, after the balance reservation is released | `handleChatCompletions` |
| Key allow-list | `model` not in the key's `allowed_models` → 403 `model_not_allowed` | `keyModelAllowed` |
| `tool_choice` | `"none"`, `"auto"`, `"required"`, or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": …}}`; a named function must exist in `tools`; `required` or a named choice with no tools → 400 | `validateToolConstraintPolicy` |
| Tool schemas | Normalised to strict JSON Schema before dispatch; schemas the constraint parser cannot compile → 422 | `NormalizeToolSchemas`, `validateResolvedToolConstraintParser` |
| Vision | Image parts require a vision-capable model, otherwise 400; a vision model with no vision-capable provider online → 503 `model_unavailable` | `detectMediaRequirement` (`coordinator/api/request_introspection.go`), `visionToolsFailFast` (`coordinator/api/inference_preprocess.go`) |
| Remote images | `http(s)` `image_url` parts are gated before dispatch and fetched by the coordinator; the fetch is billed as media | `gateRemoteMediaPreDispatch`, `resolveRemoteMedia` (`coordinator/api/media_resolve.go`) |
| Forced media tools / media tool results | Requires explicit per-model native media-tool capability. A public model served only by providers lacking it → 400, `param: model`; no currently eligible capable provider → 503. Applies to `required`/named tools with media and media-bearing tool results even with `tool_choice: none`. Other vision/tool checks remain; `response_format` is not validated by the coordinator | `nativeMediaToolsFailFast`, `coordinator/api/native_media_tools.go` |
| Token rate limits | Per-account input and output tokens per minute → 429 with `Retry-After` | `applyTokenRateLimitWithAdmission`, `writeTokenRateLimited` |
| Model shedding | A model currently rejecting → 429 with `Retry-After` from `estimateRetryAfter` | `shedIfModelRejected` |

## Timeouts and constants

| Constant | Value | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inferenceTimeout` | 600 s | `coordinator/api/consumer.go` | Streaming: maximum silence between chunks (the timer resets on every chunk) → terminal SSE `error` event, type `timeout`. Non-streaming: remaining response wait after first-content commit → 504 `timeout` |
| `defaultFirstContentDeadlineBase` | the compiled default of [`EIGENINFERENCE_TTFT_LIVE_DEADLINE_BASE_MS`](configuration.md#routing-admission-and-ttft) | `coordinator/api/consumer.go` | Fallback base of the request-absolute first-content deadline for selected accounts when the variable is unset. Other accounts have no SLA deadline or provider budget. Deadline = `CoordinatorFirstContentDeadline(model, promptTokens, base)` = base + 1 ms per estimated prompt token, tightened per model by exact-model overrides (`coordinator/modelpolicy/first_content_deadline.go`, replaceable via `EIGENINFERENCE_MODEL_FIRST_CONTENT_BASES`). Expiry before any content → 429 `rate_limit_exceeded` + `Retry-After` (the pre-content 504 is reclassified by `classifyExhaustedStatus`) |
| `preambleContentTimeout` | 90 s | `coordinator/api/consumer.go` | For SLA-selected accounts, cap from a provider's first preamble chunk (role delta / Responses lifecycle event, nothing written to the client yet) to its first content chunk; a provider that stalls after preamble fails over instead of holding the request for `inferenceTimeout`. Never exceeds the remaining first-content budget |
| `maxDispatchAttempts` | 64 | `coordinator/api/consumer.go` | Upper bound on provider attempts per request |
| `chunkBufferSize` | 256 | `coordinator/api/consumer.go` | Pre-commit chunk buffer per attempt |
| `apiKeyCacheTTL` | 60 s | `coordinator/api/server.go` | API-key lookups are cached; a revocation takes effect within one TTL |
| `coordinatorDrainRetryAfter` / `DefaultDrainGrace` | 3 s / 600 s | `coordinator/api/drain.go` | `Retry-After` on the drain 429; default drain window |
| `DeviceCodeExpiry` / `DeviceCodePollInterval` | see [Device-code flow](#device-code-flow-3) | `coordinator/api/device_auth.go` | Device-code lifetime and poll interval |
| `maxLogReportBodySize` | 10 MB | `coordinator/api/log_report_handlers.go` | Provider log upload cap |
| `degradedRouteEWMAThresholdMs` / `maxDistressRetryAfter` | 1000 ms / 60 s | `coordinator/api/consumer.go` | Input threshold and cap for `estimateRetryAfter` |
| `DefaultRetryAfter` / `maxRetryAfter` | 1 s / 60 s | `coordinator/ratelimit/ratelimit.go` | Clamp for limiter `Retry-After` |
| `exactCacheStatusCacheTTL` | 1 s | `coordinator/api/exact_cache_status.go` | `/v1/cache/status` cache |

## Version gating

Two distinct version values govern providers:

- `LatestProviderVersion = "0.9.10"` (`coordinator/api/server.go`) is the source's provider-version display fallback. `handleVersion` (`/api/version`) and `/v1/me/summary` report the highest active release in the store and fall back to this constant when none is registered. With production App Attest serving enabled, `/api/version` returns 503 instead of a download fallback when release authorization is unavailable. Preparing a source bump does not create a release row or alter `/v1/releases/latest`.
- `EIGENINFERENCE_MIN_PROVIDER_VERSION` (`MinProviderVersion`, `coordinator/api/server_config.go`; `SetMinProviderVersion`) is the **routing floor**: a provider that registers or re-attests below it stays connected but is marked not runtime-verified and excluded from routing (`belowMinProviderVersion` in `coordinator/api/server.go`, applied at registration, in `applyChallengeMinVersionPolicy` and in manifest sync). While a floor is set, a provider that reports no version counts as below it.
- **Request-shape gates** exclude providers from specific request traits rather than the whole model, and they key on advertised capabilities, not versions: inference-enforced `tool_choice` (required/named) needs the model's tool-constraint advertisement (`providerSupportsToolConstraintLocked`, `coordinator/registry/tool_constraints.go`), and a build reporting `template_render_ok=false` serves no request for that model (`providerEligibleForTraitsLocked`, `coordinator/registry/request_traits.go`). Servability and pooled admission assume the routed fleet is past the routing floor and carry no version branches. When no provider clears a gate for a request, the client sees 503 `model_unavailable` (or 400 `param: tool_choice` when the fleet serves the model but no provider advertises the tool-constraint protocol).

A consumer never sees a version error directly; an under-served model surfaces as 503 `model_unavailable`.

The exact Flash-Next registry ID also has an all-request version floor
(`qwen4RegistryMinimumProviderVersion`, `coordinator/registry/qwen4_model_policy.go`). See the
[native identity routing gate](../architecture/routing.md#native-model-capacity-and-registry-identity);
a catalog listing alone does not grant an older provider the matching policy.

## Sealed transport wire shape

Sealed mode hides request and response bodies from TLS-terminating intermediaries in front of the coordinator. It is opt-in per request and implemented in `coordinator/api/sender_encryption.go` (`handleEncryptionKey`, `sealedTransport`, `sealingResponseWriter`). The cryptographic construction and threat model are in [`../architecture/security/encryption.md`](../architecture/security/encryption.md); this section is only the wire contract.

1. `GET /v1/encryption-key` (no auth) returns `{ "kid": "…", "public_key": "<base64 32-byte X25519>", "algorithm": "x25519-nacl-box" }`.
2. Send the inference request with `Content-Type: application/eigeninference-sealed+json` and body

   ```json
   { "kid": "<kid from step 1>", "ephemeral_public_key": "<base64 32-byte X25519>", "ciphertext": "<base64: 24-byte nonce || NaCl box>" }
   ```

   `ciphertext` seals the ordinary JSON request body to the coordinator key with your ephemeral key. `kid` is optional but, when present, must match → otherwise 400 `kid_mismatch`; a malformed field → 400 `invalid_sealed_envelope`; authentication failure → 400 `decryption_failed`; sealing not configured → 503 `encryption_unavailable`. The decrypted body is then handled exactly like a plaintext request.
3. Responses carry `X-Eigen-Sealed: true` and `X-Eigen-Sealed-Kid: <kid>`. A non-streaming response has `Content-Type: application/eigeninference-sealed+json` and body `{ "kid": "…", "ciphertext": "…" }` whose plaintext is the normal JSON response. A streaming response keeps `Content-Type: text/event-stream`; every complete SSE event (split at `\n\n`, including the `data: [DONE]` frame) is sealed as a whole and re-emitted as `data: <base64 nonce || box>\n\n`, so the client decrypts each frame to recover the original event text.
4. Errors produced before the sealed layer runs (401, 429 including drain) are plain JSON.

## Device-code and API key shapes

### API key shapes

`APIKeyResponse` (`coordinator/api/types/types.go`): `id` (`key_<hex>`, `GenerateKeyID`), `name`, `label`, `disabled`, `limit_usd`, `limit_reset`, `usage_usd`, `remaining_usd`, `rpm_limit`, `itpm_limit`, `otpm_limit`, `allowed_models`, `self_route_only`, `expires_at`, `created_at`, `last_used_at`. The secret is `KeyPrefix` (`sk-db-`) + 64 hex characters (`GenerateRawKey`, `coordinator/store/apikey.go`), is returned only by create and rotate, and is stored only as its SHA-256 hash (`hashKey`, `coordinator/store/postgres.go`). `POST /v1/keys` and `PATCH /v1/keys/{id}` accept `name`, `limit_usd`, `limit_reset`, `rpm_limit`, `itpm_limit`, `otpm_limit`, `allowed_models`, `expires_at`, `self_route_only`; PATCH also accepts `disabled` (`coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`).

### Device code shapes

See the [Device-code flow](#device-code-flow-3) table for the three bodies. `verification_uri` is `<console>/link` when `EIGENINFERENCE_CONSOLE_URL` is set, else `<scheme>://<request host>/link` (`handleDeviceCode`).

### International withdrawal confirmation

For `payout_rail=global`, submit `{amount_usd, method:"standard", quote_id}` to the existing withdrawal endpoint. A confirmed quote returns its original withdrawal on retry. The response/history include `payout_rail`, `destination_amount`, `payout_currency` and `refunded`. Global states are `pending`, `processing`, `posted`, `failed`, `canceled` and `returned`; `posted` does not establish bank receipt. Quotes expire before first confirmation; an already-submitted withdrawal can still be checked with the same ID (`coordinator/api/global_payouts_withdraw.go`, `maybeGlobalWithdraw`).

`DELETE /v1/billing/stripe/account` removes a Global Payouts recipient mapping first, when present, and preserves any stored Connect destination; that older destination may become visible again. Otherwise it clears the Connect mapping. Responses are `{unlinked:true}` when a mapping was removed and `{unlinked:false}` when neither exists. Stripe accounts remain open and submitted withdrawals keep their recorded destination (`coordinator/api/stripe_payouts.go`, `handleStripeUnlink`).

An unsubmitted confirmation invalidated by paused admissions returns 409 `quote_paused`; changed payout settings return 409 `payout_changed`. The browser releases that saved confirmation. Invalidation is atomic with `BeginGlobalPayout`; if another confirmation has already debited, the endpoint returns/reconciles the existing withdrawal instead. A recipient minimum/maximum violation returns 400 `recipient_amount_limit` with the threshold in local currency (`coordinator/api/global_payouts_withdraw.go`, `maybeGlobalWithdraw`, `handleGlobalPayoutQuote`).

An unknown payout outcome held for manual reconciliation remains `status=pending` and exposes `failure_reason=manual_reconciliation_required`. History displays **Needs review**; the debit remains reserved, and automatic scans and repeated confirmations do not resubmit or refund it (`coordinator/store/global_payouts.go`, `GlobalPayout.RequiresManualReconciliation`; `coordinator/api/global_payouts_history.go`, `globalWithdrawalView`).

## Model token promotions

| Method/path | Authorization | Behavior | Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PUT /v1/admin/token-promotions` | Admin | Create immutable terms or toggle `enabled` for an exact model ID, even before registration | `coordinator/api/model_token_promotions.go` (`handleAdminModelTokenPromotions`) |
| `GET /v1/admin/token-promotions` | Admin | List configured promotions | `coordinator/api/model_token_promotions.go` (`handleAdminModelTokenPromotions`) |
| `POST /v1/me/token-promotions/claim` | Privy only | Explicitly claim the requested `model_id` for an eligible individual account; atomically enforce signup cutoff and campaign capacity | `coordinator/api/model_token_promotions.go` (`handleMyModelTokenPromotions`) |
| `GET /v1/me/token-promotions` | Privy only | Return account grants and available offers without issuing any | `coordinator/api/model_token_promotions.go` (`handleMyModelTokenPromotions`) |

Promotion input is `{ "model_id": "...", "tokens": 150000000, "claim_starts_at": "RFC3339", "claim_ends_at": "RFC3339 or null", "signup_cutoff_at": "RFC3339", "max_claims": 250, "enabled": true }`. Signup eligibility is strictly before `signup_cutoff_at` using the persisted account creation timestamp. `max_claims` accepts integers in `[1, 1000000]`. A null claim end is supported, but the Bonsai launch draft has an explicit end. Only `enabled` is mutable; conflicting terms return `409 promotion_conflict`. Tokens are integers in `[1, 1000000000000]`. Grant responses have a `grants` array containing `model_id`, `total_tokens`, `used_tokens`, `reserved_tokens`, `remaining_tokens` (available after reservations), and `claimed_at`. There is no expiry field. Claiming requires `{"model_id":"..."}`, uses the server clock and does not require catalog registration. Repeated successful claims return the existing grant without consuming another slot, including after the window or cap closes. Service accounts receive no grant. Responses also include `offers` with `model_id`, `tokens`, `max_claims`, `remaining_claims`, `signup_cutoff_at`, `claim_ends_at` and `status` (`available`, `claimed`, `sold_out`, `ineligible`, or `unavailable`). Claim failures return `403 promotion_ineligible`, `409 promotion_sold_out`, `409 promotion_unavailable`, or `404 promotion_not_found`.

Inference returns `402 free_tokens_exhausted` when the claimed allowance is exhausted or held by active requests and paid balance is insufficient. `402 promotion_balance_required` means remaining free tokens plus paid balance cannot cover the request's upper bound. Both carry an OpenAI-compatible `error.code` and user-facing message. Paid fallback succeeds when funded. See [operations/model-token-promotions.md](../operations/model-token-promotions.md).
