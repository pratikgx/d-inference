# Configuration reference

> Last updated: 2026-09-28 · commit `79dcac0f4`

Every environment variable read by the coordinator, the provider CLI
(`darkbloom`), console-ui and admin-ui: accepted values, the compiled default,
the code that reads it, and its effect. Defaults are the fallbacks at the cited
symbol; a production or dev host may pin a different value in its environment
file. Secrets are named, never valued. Unless a row says *live*, the variable is
read once at process start and a restart applies a change.

[App Attest shadow configuration](app-attest-shadow.md#configuration) defines evidence collection and receipt renewal. [Provider authorization](provider-authorization.md#controls) defines the separate serving and MDM-removal opt-ins, both disabled by default. The account cohort, safe-version floor and qualified build/code hashes remain required. `EIGENINFERENCE_APP_ATTEST_KEY_ROTATION_PERCENT` (default `100`) selects the separate account cohort for coordinator-requested [dead-key rotation](app-attest-shadow.md#dead-key-rotation). [Durable build approvals](provider-authorization.md#durable-build-qualification) replace per-release env edits; existing env pairs are a bootstrap fallback that cannot override a durable revocation. Shadow alone grants no trust; an explicitly enabled qualified App Attest path can replace legacy serving verification.

## Provider drain deadline

| Setting | Default / bounds | Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `darkbloom start/stop/restart/update --timeout` | `600` seconds; 0–3600 | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ServiceDrain.swift` (`DrainOptions`) |
| `darkbloom switch --timeout` | `600` seconds; 0–3600; `0` means no waiting for unfinished work, with a 30-second barrier allowance when already settled; no force mode | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/SwitchCommand.swift` (`Switch`); `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+ModelSwitch.swift` (`drainForModelSwitch`) |
| `darkbloom restart --startup-timeout` | `180` seconds; 1–3600 | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/RestartCommand.swift` (`Restart`) |
| `DARKBLOOM_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `600` seconds when missing/invalid; valid 1–3600 | Signal/AppKit and planned metadata-reconnect drain in `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/ProviderTermination.swift` (`timeoutSeconds`); launchd environment allowlist preserves it |
| launchd `ExitTimeOut` | `3660` seconds on install or CLI restart | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/LaunchAgent.swift` (`makeServicePlist`, `refreshTerminationAllowance`) |

A start/stop/restart/update CLI deadline expiry leaves a running, non-admitting
process and disables watchdog/login restart. A `switch` timeout also keeps
accepted work alive and admission closed, but never changes recovery settings.
Signal-only shutdown preserves configured login startup. See [lifecycle commands](../provider/cli-reference.md#graceful-stop-and-restart)
for recovery and explicit force semantics. Existing loaded launchd jobs must be
restarted to adopt the new allowance. Local mailbox files are owner-only under
`lifecycle/` beside the daemon state file and bind PID plus kernel process-start
time; they are not network control endpoints or serving credentials.

## Provider model selection

| Setting | Default / precedence | Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `backend.enabled_models` | `[]` means all eligible local models; a successful `switch` pins its complete nonempty selection | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/ProviderModelSelection.swift` (`save`) |
| launchd-managed `start --foreground --model` | Explicitly pinned `enabled_models` overrides stale baked arguments, including restart and watchdog recovery | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StartCommand.swift` (`usesPinnedModelSelection`); `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StartCommand+Modes.swift` (`runForeground`) |
| direct manual `start --foreground --model` | Explicit command-line IDs still override the saved selection | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StartCommand+Modes.swift` (`runForeground`) |
| later scheduled serving windows | Keep the initial foreground selection until a live switch or saved `enabled_models` change; then resolve an empty list to all eligible local models, validating and hashing the selected set before each window. Hashing consumes the original window duration; an expired window does not start serving | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ScheduledWindowSelection.swift` (`ScheduledWindowSelection`); `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StartCommand+Modes.swift` (`runScheduled`) |

`start` saves its selected models under the lifecycle lease before disabling
recovery or draining/stopping the current daemon; persistence failure leaves it
running. Live [`switch`](../provider/cli-reference.md#darkbloom-switch) uses the running
daemon's resolved config path and does not optimistically write from the CLI.
The daemon persists the accepted selection using a stable config sidecar lock,
reloading before saving so unrelated settings survive concurrent config writes.
`darkbloom autoupdate enable` and `disable` use that lock and reload before
saving `provider.auto_update`, so they preserve a concurrent switch selection
(`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/AutoUpdateCommand.swift`, `setAutoUpdate`).
Other config changes remain process-start settings unless documented otherwise.
For replacement start, the same sidecar lock covers saving and synchronous
drain setup. Setup failure restores the original bytes or file absence, so
legacy unpinned selections stay unpinned; a timeout after publication retains
the new intent. The lock is released before waiting for drain completion
(`ProviderModelSelection.withReplacement` in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/ProviderModelSelection.swift`).
Missing explicit config paths use the already-resolved startup/loop configuration,
never another path's canonical config. Live switch stages a presence-aware
rollback snapshot, releases the lock for the network wait, and restores only its
model-selection key when other settings changed concurrently. A newer selection
causes a reported conflict instead of being overwritten (`stageReplacement`,
`restore` in the same module).


## Where values are set

| Component | Where the process gets its environment |
|---|---|
| Coordinator, production | `/etc/d-inference/env` (root-only, boot disk) on the Confidential VM. Secrets are placed by hand; `deploy/gcp/prod/refresh-env.sh` runs before Docker at every boot, adds any key from `deploy/gcp/prod/release-env-defaults` that is absent, migrates a few exact historical values, never overwrites an operator-set value, and refuses to run when a required key is missing or empty. The list of keys production must have is maintained once in [`../operations/coordinator-deploy.md#environment-file`](../operations/coordinator-deploy.md#environment-file). The container entrypoint `coordinator/deploy/start.sh` reads `USER_PERSISTENT_DATA_PATH`, `MICROMDM_API_KEY`, `MDM_PUSH_P12_B64`, `DOMAIN` and `EIGENINFERENCE_MDM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` itself before it `exec`s the `coordinator` binary; everything else is read by Go code. |
| Coordinator, dev | Same file layout on the dev VM, written by `deploy/gcp/refresh-env.sh`; see [`../operations/dev-environment.md`](../operations/dev-environment.md). |
| Coordinator, local | Whatever shell exports `go run ./coordinator/cmd/coordinator` inherits. `EIGENINFERENCE_ALLOW_MEMORY_STORE=true` is the only way to start without a database. |
| Provider CLI, `darkbloom start --foreground` | The invoking shell's environment, minus the 13 variables scrubbed by `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Security/EnvironmentScrubber.swift`. Every `DARKBLOOM_*` row below applies. |
| Provider CLI, installed LaunchAgent | `darkbloom start` writes a launchd plist whose `EnvironmentVariables` come from `LaunchAgent.passthroughEnvironment` in `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/LaunchAgent.swift`. The allow-list includes `DARKBLOOM_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE`, `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MEMORY`, `DARKBLOOM_MLX_RESOURCE_DEBUG`, `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_KV`, `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_MTP`, `DARKBLOOM_MTP_MAX_RECTANGULAR_TOKENS`, `DARKBLOOM_KV_BACKEND_GUARD`, `DARKBLOOM_MLX_CACHE_LIMIT_GB`, `DARKBLOOM_MLX_MEMORY_RESERVE_GB`, `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_MAX_PARTIAL_PREFILLS`, and `DARKBLOOM_PREFILL_DEADLINE_MODE`; `MLX_GATHER_QMM_EXPERT_SLICES` is forwarded only when exactly `1`. `PATH` and the Hugging Face/XDG cache variables are not forwarded. Model-cache selection is config-backed. The watchdog (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/WatchdogAgent.swift`) additionally forwards `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`. |
| Provider CLI, `provider.toml` | `~/.config/darkbloom/provider.toml` (`ConfigManager` in `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift`) is the durable configuration and the only path read unless `--config` is given; there is no legacy-location fallback or copy (under `sudo darkbloom report`, the invoking user's `~/.config/darkbloom/provider.toml`, from `ConfigManager.defaultConfigPath(home:)`); a variable that overrides a config key says so in its Effect cell (`DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_KV`, `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_MTP`, `DARKBLOOM_MLX_MEMORY_RESERVE_GB`, `DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_CHUNK_EVAL`). |
| console-ui | Next.js `.env*` files or the hosting build environment (Vercel-style). Every console-ui variable is `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` or build-tooling: inlined at **build** time, so changing one requires a rebuild. There is no server-only secret; a gitignored `.env.local` in `console-ui/` is the only local file and no `.env.example` exists. |
| admin-ui | Server-only **runtime** variables read by React Server Components on each request; set them in `.env*` or the host environment. `NODE_ENV` is set by Next. |

### Auth: admin key, Privy, release key, sender encryption

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_ADMIN_KEY` | secret | unset (warning; no seeded key) | `coordinator/store/config.go` (`ReadConfig`); `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`ReadServerConfig`); `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SeedKey`) | Bootstrap admin API key seeded into `api_keys`; bearer token for `/v1/admin/*`, release registration and state export. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_ADMIN_EMAILS` | comma-separated emails | unset | `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`ReadServerConfig`, `ParseCommaList`) | Privy accounts with these emails get admin on console-facing admin routes. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_RELEASE_KEY` | secret | unset | `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`ReadServerConfig`); `coordinator/api/release_handlers.go` | Bearer token accepted (constant-time) for release registration in addition to the admin key. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_PRIVY_APP_ID` | string | unset (Privy auth off) | `coordinator/auth/config.go` (`ReadConfig`) | Enables Privy JWT verification; also the expected JWT audience. |

See [`../architecture/security/encryption.md`](../architecture/security/encryption.md). |

### MDM, attestation and APNs

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MICROMDM_API_KEY` | secret | unset (MicroMDM is not started) | `coordinator/deploy/start.sh` | Starts the in-container MicroMDM with this API key; must be byte-identical to `EIGENINFERENCE_MDM_API_KEY`. |

| `EIGENINFERENCE_MDM_API_KEY` | secret | compiled placeholder (`defaultMDMApiKey`) | `coordinator/mdm/config.go` (`ReadConfig`) | API key for MicroMDM calls; production sets a real key. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MDM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | secret | unset (warning; webhook relies on the CommandUUID gate) | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go`; `coordinator/deploy/start.sh` | Shared secret MicroMDM must present on `/v1/mdm/webhook` (`?token=` or `X-Webhook-Token`); `start.sh` appends it to the webhook URL. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MDM_SCHEDULER_WORKERS` | integer 1–12 | `12` | `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`readMDMSchedulerConfig`) | Verification worker pool size (values above 12 clamp down). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MDM_SCHEDULER_QUEUE_CAPACITY` | integer 1–4096 | `4096` | `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`readMDMSchedulerConfig`) | Verification queue capacity (clamped). |

| `EIGENINFERENCE_MDM_CLAIM_TTL` | Go duration 2m–15m | `3m` | `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`readMDMSchedulerConfig`) | Lease on a claimed verification job. |
| `PROFILE_SIGNING_P12_B64`, `PROFILE_SIGNING_P12_PATH`, `PROFILE_SIGNING_P12_PASSWORD` | base64 or path to PKCS#12, password (secrets) | unset (profiles served unsigned) | `coordinator/profilesign/signer.go` (`LoadFromEnv`) | CMS-signs the `/v1/enroll` `.mobileconfig`. |

| `EIGENINFERENCE_TRUST_GEO_HEADERS` | `1` | unset | `coordinator/api/provider_geo.go` (`newProviderGeoResolverFromEnv`) | Trust proxy-supplied client-IP headers when geolocating providers. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_IPAPI_KEY` | secret | unset (free ip-api.com tier) | `coordinator/api/provider_geo.go` (`newProviderGeoResolverFromEnv`) | Uses the keyed `pro.ip-api.com` endpoint for provider geolocation. |

### Release policy, version floor and binary hashes

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MIN_PROVIDER_VERSION` | semver | unset (no floor) | `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`ReadServerConfig`); `coordinator/api/server.go` (`belowMinProviderVersion`) | Providers below this version stay connected but are excluded from routing at registration, challenge revalidation and manifest sync; while a floor is set, a provider that reports no version counts as below it. Never derived from releases. Surfaced to operators in `/v1/me`. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_RELEASE_POLICY_MODE` | `shadow`, `enforce` | `shadow` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` | Whether missing application evidence blocks routing; see [`../operations/release-policy-rollout.md`](../operations/release-policy-rollout.md). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_RELEASE_POLICY_ENFORCE_GRACE` | Go duration ≥ 20m (raise-only) | `20m` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` | Boot grace before enforcement bites; shorter values clamp up to 20m. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_BINARYHASH_ENFORCE` | `true` | `false` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SetBinaryHashEnforcement`) | Re-enables legacy derouting on a self-reported `binaryHash` mismatch (rollback only). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_KNOWN_BINARY_HASHES` | comma-separated hashes | unset | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`AddKnownBinaryHashes`) | Extra known-good provider binary hashes beyond the active releases in the store. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_KNOWN_TEMPLATE_HASHES` | `name=hash,…`; a repeated name accepts every listed hash | unset | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SetRuntimeManifest`) | Replaces the store-built [runtime manifest](../architecture/security/attestation.md#runtime-manifest) at boot; discarded by the next release registration or deactivation, which rebuilds the union from active releases. |

### Routing, admission and TTFT

First-content ranking is active by default with no mode or percentage setting.
The 100-ms band, confidence/freshness rules and bounded retry policy are defined
in [first-content routing](../architecture/first-content-routing.md). Existing
TTFT shadow metrics remain observational and do not control this selection.


Trust floor, model routing and per-request quality:

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MIN_TRUST` | `none`, `self_signed`, `hardware` | `hardware` (`registry.New`) | `coordinator/registry/config.go` (`ReadConfig`, `Check`) | Minimum trust level a provider needs to receive public traffic; an unknown value refuses startup. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_DEDICATED_MODELS` | comma-separated family patterns, or `none` | `gemma-4` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go`; `coordinator/registry/dedicated_models.go` (`ParseDedicatedModels`) | Model families that get dedicated-provider routing; `none` disables. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_REJECT_MODELS` | comma-separated model ids | unset | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SetRejectModels`) | Sheds the listed models with 429 at admission. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MIN_DECODE_TPS` | float ≥ 0 (`0` disables) | `15` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SetMinDecodeTPS`) | Per-request decode floor (tokens/s) used by admission; see [`../architecture/scheduling.md`](../architecture/scheduling.md). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_DECODE_FLOOR_USE_FLEET_MEDIAN` | bool | `true` (*live*) | `coordinator/registry/scheduler.go` (`decodeFloorUseFleetMedian`) | Lets the per-request decode projection fall back to the fleet-median solo rate before the static benchmark. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_SERVABILITY_GATE` | bool | `true` (*live*) | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go`; `coordinator/api/servability_gate.go` (`servabilityGateEnabled`) | Early 429 for requests whose prompt + `max_tokens` fit no provider; only an explicit `false` disables it. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_LONG_PROMPT_TOKENS` | integer > 0 | unset (preference off) | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SetLongPromptThreshold`) | Threshold for the retained historical cost diagnostic; active first-content selection uses measured forecast work for every prompt size. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_LONG_PROMPT_PREFILL_WEIGHT` | float (values below 1 clamp to neutral) | `2.0` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SetLongPromptPrefillWeight`) | Long-prompt weight in the historical cost diagnostic; read only when the threshold is set. Does not widen the first-content band. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_PREFILL_DECODE_RATIO` | float > 0 | `12.0` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go`; `coordinator/registry/scheduler.go` (`SetPrefillToDecodeRatio`) | Prefill-to-decode speed ratio in the TTFT estimate. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_PROMPT_CALIBRATION` | `family:factor,…` (factors ≥ 1.0) | built-in table (`gpt-oss:1.3`) | `coordinator/api/prompt_calibration.go` (`SetPromptContextCalibrationFromEnv`) | Replaces per-family prompt-token calibration for the context gate and conservative first-content work; physical and billing estimates remain separate. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_FIRST_CONTENT_SLA_ACCOUNTS` | comma-separated exact account IDs or stored emails | empty (no accounts); provision selected identities in the deployment environment | `coordinator/api/first_content_accounts.go` (`accountHasFirstContentSLA`); `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`ReadServerConfig`) | Enables the request-absolute SLA only for selected authenticated accounts. Email matching is case-insensitive and uses the stored user, never headers or the service role. Verify the production selector before rollout; a verified account ID avoids dependence on email changes. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MODEL_FIRST_CONTENT_SLAS` | `model=upstream_base_ms:per_input_token_ms,…`; `model=off` removes | Bonsai exact IDs: `10000:5` | `coordinator/modelpolicy/first_content_sla.go` (`SetFirstContentSLAsFromEnv`) | For selected accounts, overrides both SLA terms for exact model IDs; an explicit public alias policy takes precedence over the resolved build. Retains one second of coordinator headroom. Base 1001–600000 ms, slope 0–100 ms/token; invalid/duplicate entries fail startup atomically. Applied after the legacy base table. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MODEL_FIRST_CONTENT_BASES` | `model=upstream_ms,…` (`0`/`off` removes) | built-in table | `coordinator/modelpolicy/first_content_deadline.go` (`SetFirstContentBasesFromEnv`) | Overrides exact-model first-content deadline bases. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_HEALTH_EJECTION` | `off`/`0`/`false`/`no` disables | on | `coordinator/registry/health_ejection_switch.go` (`healthEjectionSwitch`, parsed once at package init); `coordinator/registry/health_ejection.go` (`healthEjectionEnabled`) | Kill switch for provider health ejection; see [`../architecture/routing.md`](../architecture/routing.md). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_DISABLE_CLIENT_ERROR_STOP` | bool | `false` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SetDisableClientErrorStop`) | Lets deterministic provider 4xx errors fail over instead of stopping the dispatch ladder. |

TTFT admission and dispatch termination:

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_TTFT_HARD_REJECT` | `true` | `false` (soft preference) | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`SetTTFTHardReject`) | Enables 429 when all eligible candidates have credible conservative first-content forecasts beyond the original remaining deadline; Unknown evidence is not hard rejected. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_TTFT_LIVE_DEADLINE_BASE_MS` | 1000–120000 | `5000` (production pins `9000`) | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` (`validateTTFTDeadlineBaseMs`) | Live first-content deadline base for selected accounts (`FirstContentDeadlineBase`, plus 1 ms per prompt token); legacy base-only policy may tighten it; an explicit model SLA overrides both terms. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_TTFT_DEADLINE_BASE_MS` | 1000–120000 | `10000` | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go`; `coordinator/registry/ttft_shadow.go` | Deadline base for shadow TTFT evaluation. |

| `EIGENINFERENCE_TTFT_CALIBRATION` | `off`/`false`/`0` disables | `on` (*live*) | `coordinator/registry/ttft_calibration.go` (`ttftCalibrationEnabled`) | Historical TTFT diagnostic calibration; off returns ratio 1.0. It does not certify first-content feasibility. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_TTFT_TERMINAL_REJECT` | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` disables | `true` (*live*) | `coordinator/api/dispatch.go` (`ttftTerminalRejectEnabled`) | Legacy text TTFT refusal handling; typed predictive refusals use the bounded fresh-evidence ladder in `coordinator/api/first_content_retry.go`. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_JINJA_TERMINAL_REJECT` | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` disables | `true` (*live*) | `coordinator/api/dispatch.go` (`jinjaTerminalRejectEnabled`) | A chat-template render failure ends the ladder with one 422 instead of failing over. |

Queue and cold dispatch:

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_QUEUE_MAX_DEPTH` | integer ≥ 1 | `32` | `coordinator/registry/queue.go` (`NewRequestQueueFromEnv`) | Per-model queue depth before 429. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_QUEUE_MAX_WAIT` | Go duration > 0 | `120s` | `coordinator/registry/queue.go` (`NewRequestQueueFromEnv`) | Upper bound on eligible queue waits; a public deadline-bound request also needs credible useful release evidence. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_QUEUE_BEFORE_SHED` | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` disables | `true` (*live*) | `coordinator/api/cold_dispatch.go` (`queueBeforeShedEnabled`) | Permit `machine_busy` preflight requests to reach dispatch queue policy. Public deadlines still require credible capacity-release evidence; owner/exempt requests retain queue behavior. |

Reservation commit lock:

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_RESERVE_COMMIT_MODE` | `shared`, `global` (trimmed, case-insensitive; any other value is treated as `shared` and logged as unknown) | `shared` | `coordinator/registry/gate_commit_mode.go` (`loadReserveCommitMode`, `parseReserveCommitMode`); read once at `registry.New` | How the reservation commit (`commitProviderReservation`, `ReserveNextFromPlan`) holds the registry lock. `shared` commits under `r.mu.RLock` plus the winner's `p.mu`; `global` is the kill switch that restores the fleet-wide `r.mu.Lock()` commit serialization. The fault-tracker recorders stay on their per-identity gates in both modes; see [`../architecture/routing.md`](../architecture/routing.md). |

Quality concurrency cap:

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_QUALITY_CONCURRENCY_CAP` | bool | `true` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` (`ReadConfig`) | Per-provider admission cap derived from each model's quality concurrency instead of the flat cap. |

#### Warm pool

All read once in `ReadConfig` (`coordinator/registry/config.go`); the controller
they tune is explained in
[scheduling.md → Warm-pool controller](../architecture/scheduling.md#warm-pool-controller):

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_WARM_POOL_ENABLED` | bool | `true` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | Runs the warm-pool controller (`StartWarmPoolController`). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_WARM_POOL_OBSERVE_ONLY` | bool | `false` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | Compute targets and metrics without issuing loads. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_WARM_POOL_INTERVAL` | Go duration > 0 | `10s` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | Controller tick. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_WARM_POOL_MIN_DWELL` | Go duration | `5m` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | Minimum time a model stays warm before it may be unloaded. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_WARM_POOL_QUEUE_AGE_THRESHOLD` | Go duration | `0` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | Queue age that counts as pressure. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_WARM_POOL_CAPACITY_REJECT_THRESHOLD` | integer ≥ 1 | `1` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | Capacity rejects per tick that count as pressure. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_WARM_POOL_WARM_SATURATION_THRESHOLD` | float 0–1 | `0.8` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | Warm-slot utilisation that counts as pressure. |

Cache-aware routing (semantics in [`../architecture/cache-aware-routing.md`](../architecture/cache-aware-routing.md)). `refresh-env.sh` seeds absent keys from `deploy/gcp/prod/release-env-defaults` — production ships `MODE=off`, `PERCENT=1`, `MAX_PLAN_QPS=1` — and never overwrites a value an operator has set:

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_MODE` | `off`, `on` | `off` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` (`ReadConfig`, `CacheRoutingConfig.Check`) | Enables provider-confirmed cache routing; any other value refuses startup. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_ALLOWED_ARTIFACTS` | JSON array of exact identity triples; at most 64 KiB / 128 entries | unset (unrestricted eligibility) | `coordinator/registry/cache_artifact_allowlist.go` (`readCacheRoutingArtifacts`, `newCacheArtifactAllowlist`) | Restricts network cache participation before cohort/QPS/sidecar work; `[]` denies all. Invalid configuration refuses startup, including while mode is `off`. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_PERCENT` | float (0, 100] | `100` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` (`envStrictFloat`) | Share of eligible requests that use cache routing; malformed values refuse startup. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_MAX_PLAN_QPS` | float 0–1,000,000 | `0` (unlimited) | `coordinator/registry/config.go` (`envStrictFloat`) | Rate limit on cache-plan computation. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_TTL` | Go duration ≥ 0 | `10m` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | SSD holder lifetime; resident holders use the smaller of this value and `cacheRoutingMemoryTTL = 30 * time.Second` (`coordinator/registry/cache_tiers.go`, `receiptTTL`). The in-memory holder and demand indexes are sized for at most `30m`; a longer value is accepted and logged as a warning at startup (`warnCacheRoutingTTL`). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_MAX_HOLDERS` | integer 1–32 | `4` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` | Maximum machines per exact content prefix and tier, across provider epochs. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_PERSIST` | bool | `true` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` (`env.EnvBool`) | Keep the holder and observed-demand indexes in the store across coordinator restarts (`coordinator/registry/cache_persistence.go`). Memory stays the serving copy; the store is a write-behind copy flushed every 5 s and reloaded at boot. `false` serves from an empty index after every restart. No effect when the store cannot persist. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_MAX_DISCOUNT_MS` | optional float 0–10000 | unset/blank | `coordinator/registry/cache_score_config.go` (`optionalCacheScoreLimit`) | Optional millisecond cap on avoidable-prefill score credit; explicit `0` grants no credit. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_MAX_COST_FRACTION` | optional float 0–1 | unset/blank | `coordinator/registry/cache_score_config.go` (`optionalCacheScoreLimit`) | Optional cap as a fraction of baseline total cost, alongside the prefill-work bound; explicit `0` grants no credit. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_MASTER_KEY` | secret key material | unset; required when mode is `on` | `coordinator/registry/config.go` (`decodeCacheMasterKey`) | Keys the affinity digests so raw identity and prefix bytes are never stored. |

The optional artifact array uses exactly `model_id`, `model_aggregate_sha256`
and `prompt_contract_id` string fields. Model IDs match resolved catalog IDs
exactly (at most 512 bytes, no wildcard, surrounding whitespace or control
separators); both hashes must be 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters. Missing,
unknown or duplicate fields, duplicate tuples, `null`, a blank setting, trailing
JSON and oversized input are configuration errors. Multiple exact revisions of
one model may be listed as distinct tuples. An absent variable preserves the
existing unrestricted eligibility; `[]` is an explicitly configured empty list.
`MODE=off` still disables participation with any list.

The list is parsed once at startup and compiled into immutable membership;
`ConfigureCacheRouting` replaces it with the holder/attempt tracker. Exclusion
returns ordinary `ineligible` without a reusable remote scope or inference
error. It does not alter provider capabilities or local HTTP cache policy
(`coordinator/registry/cache_route_keys.go`, `PlanCacheRouteWithResult`). No
artifact entries are populated by the shipped defaults; follow the
[rollout runbook](../operations/cache-routing-rollout.md) to configure a measured
artifact subset before activating network routing.

| `EIGENINFERENCE_SERVICE_EXPECTED_OUTPUT_ADMISSION_FLOOR`, `EIGENINFERENCE_SERVICE_EXPECTED_OUTPUT_ADMISSION_CEILING` | tokens | `512`, `8192` | `coordinator/ratelimit/config.go` | Bounds on the expected-output estimate. |

Throughput anomaly detector:

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |

### Billing, Stripe and base rewards

Prices, the platform fee and the referral share live in [`../architecture/billing.md#invariants`](../architecture/billing.md#invariants); this table only names the switches.

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_BILLING_MOCK` | `true` | `false` | `coordinator/billing/config.go` (`ReadConfig`); `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` | Bypasses Stripe with an instant-credit mock (dev only). |

| `EIGENINFERENCE_STRIPE_GLOBAL_PAYOUTS_ENABLED` | bool | `true` in production release defaults; `false` otherwise | `coordinator/billing/config.go` (`ReadConfig`, `Check`); `deploy/gcp/prod/release-env-defaults` | Enables new international onboarding, quotes and withdrawals. Production refresh preserves an explicit `false` and requires the funding account and webhook secret before activation; runtime validation also requires the base `EIGENINFERENCE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` used for Connect. Reconciliation continues with configured credentials even when disabled. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_STRIPE_GLOBAL_PAYOUTS_FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT` | ID | unset | `coordinator/billing/config.go` (`Check`) | Funding financial account; required when enabled. |

| `EIGENINFERENCE_STRIPE_GLOBAL_PAYOUTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | secret | unset | `coordinator/api/global_payouts_reconcile.go` (`handleGlobalPayoutWebhook`) | Verifies the separate Global Payouts event destination; missing secret rejects all events. |

| `EIGENINFERENCE_BASE_REWARDS` | bool | `false` | `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`ReadServerConfig`) | Turns on the hourly base-rewards settlement loop. |

| `EIGENINFERENCE_R2_CDN_URL` | URL | unset | `coordinator/api/server_config.go` (`ReadServerConfig`); `coordinator/api/release_handlers.go` (`trustedReleaseArtifactURL`) | Public R2 bucket URL release binaries are pulled from; release registration is refused (503) until it is set, and every registered artifact URL must live under it. See [`../operations/release-policy-rollout.md`](../operations/release-policy-rollout.md). |

### Prompt sidecar and media fetch

Prompt sidecar (`coordinator/promptcontract/config.go`, `ReadSupervisorConfig`; every duration is an integer count of milliseconds; `Check` refuses startup on an out-of-range value when the sidecar is enabled). Semantics: [`../architecture/prompt-contract-sidecar.md`](../architecture/prompt-contract-sidecar.md).

Media fetch (`coordinator/mediafetch/config.go`, `ConfigFromEnv`; a set-but-unparseable value is recorded and fails startup in `Check`, so a mistyped kill switch cannot silently keep fetching):

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_ENABLED` | bool | `true` | `coordinator/mediafetch/config.go` | Lets the coordinator download `image_url`/`video_url` inputs and inline them as `data:` URIs before relaying; when off, requests carrying remote media are rejected. See [`../architecture/data-flow.md`](../architecture/data-flow.md). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` | bytes | `8388608` (8 MiB), `10485760` (10 MiB) | `coordinator/mediafetch/config.go` | Per-file and per-request raw download ceilings. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`, `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_TOTAL_DEADLINE_MS` | ms | `15000`, `25000` | `coordinator/mediafetch/config.go` | Per-URL fetch timeout and whole-request resolution deadline. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_GLOBAL_CONCURRENCY` | integer | `32` | `coordinator/mediafetch/config.go` | Process-wide cap on in-flight fetches. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_MAX_IMAGE_MEGAPIXELS` | integer (`0` disables) | `100` | `coordinator/mediafetch/config.go` | Header-decoded pixel cap for fetched images. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_BLOCKLIST_DOMAINS` | comma-separated hostnames | unset | `coordinator/mediafetch/config.go` | Hosts that are never fetched. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS`, `EIGENINFERENCE_MEDIA_FETCH_ALLOW_NONSTANDARD_PORTS` | bool | `false`, `false` | `coordinator/mediafetch/config.go` | SSRF guards: allow loopback/private/link-local targets or ports other than 80/443 (tests only). |

### Telemetry, Datadog and profiling

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DD_API_KEY` | secret | unset (no metric or log shipping) | `coordinator/datadog/datadog.go` (`ConfigFromEnv`); `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` | Enables the Datadog client (metrics over the HTTP API, Logs API forwarding) and the APM tracer; see [`../architecture/telemetry.md`](../architecture/telemetry.md). |
| `DD_AGENT_HOST` | hostname | unset | `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` | Also starts the APM tracer and trace-context log handler when set (agent-based deployments without an API key). |
| `DD_SITE` | Datadog site | `datadoghq.com` | `coordinator/datadog/datadog.go` (`ConfigFromEnv`) | Intake endpoint. |
| `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE` | strings | `production`, `d-inference-coordinator` | `coordinator/datadog/datadog.go` (`ConfigFromEnv`) | `env:` and `service:` tags on every series, log and trace. |
| `DD_DOGSTATSD_URL` | `host:port` | `localhost:8125` | `coordinator/datadog/datadog.go` (`ConfigFromEnv`) | DogStatsD agent address. |
| `DD_HOSTNAME` | hostname | the `DD_SERVICE` value | `coordinator/datadog/datadog.go` (`NewClient`) | `host` attribute on series shipped over the HTTP metrics API. |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_PROFILER` | `off` disables | `on` | `coordinator/api/profiler.go` (`newProfilerFromEnv`) | Kill switch for the per-request system profiler; see [`../architecture/system-profiler.md`](../architecture/system-profiler.md). |
| `EIGENINFERENCE_PROFILE_SAMPLE_RATE` | float 0–1 | `0.1` | `coordinator/api/profiler.go` (`newProfilerFromEnv`) | Fraction of successful requests the profiler samples; slow, failed and retried requests are always recorded. |

## Provider CLI (`darkbloom`)

Parsing convention: affirmative values are `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`, negative values `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`, case-insensitive. Only the variables named in the LaunchAgent allow-list above reach an installed daemon; everything else applies to `darkbloom start --foreground` and to the benchmark and test binaries.

### Startup model preload

Startup loading is independent of the idle-unload policy. The default
preloads selected models on coordinator-connected and standalone `--local`
starts; an explicit list takes precedence. All loads retain the normal memory
and slot admission checks, and a failed preload remains request-loadable.

| `provider.toml` key | Default | Effect and reader |
|---|---|---|
| `[backend] startup_preload` | `true` | Enable startup loading in `ProviderLoop.runStartupPreloadGate` and `Start.runLocalStandalone`; `false` disables it in both modes (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift`, `BackendSettings`). |
| `[backend] preload_models` | `[]` | Explicit startup order when nonempty; otherwise selected models, with the previously loaded set first on coordinator starts (`ProviderLoop.startupPreloadPlan`, `StandaloneServer.startupPreloadPlan`). |
| `[backend] startup_preload_timeout_secs` | `120` | Maximum delay before coordinator registration; remaining loads continue in the background. Standalone `--local` finishes its preload before opening the listener (`ProviderLoop.runStartupPreloadGate`, `Start.runLocalStandalone`). |
| `[backend] startup_selftest` | `true` | Coordinator-connected startup runs a one-token serving-path decode after each load; standalone `--local` loads weights and the engine but does not run this decode (`ProviderLoop.runStartupPreloadGate`, `StandaloneServer.preloadSelectedModels`). |
| `[backend] startup_selftest_fail_closed` | `false` | Coordinator-connected self-test failures can retire the model when enabled; there is no synthetic self-test or fail-closed retirement in standalone `--local` (`ProviderLoop.runStartupPreloadGate`, `StandaloneServer.preloadSelectedModels`). |
| `[backend] idle_timeout_mins` | `60` | Controls later idle unloading for coordinator serving, not whether models load at startup (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+IdleTimeout.swift`, `ProviderLoop.startupPreloadPlan`). |

### Model cache location

Model-cache changes require explicit operator selection, not a beta flag.
Discovery, downloads, hashing and removal share `ModelScanner.resolveCache`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCoreFoundation/ModelScanner+CacheDirectory.swift`).
The selected directory is a hub root containing
`models--<org>--<name>/snapshots/<revision>`, not a single model snapshot.

| Runtime setting | Cache directory | Reader |
|---|---|---|
| `[backend] model_cache_directory` in `provider.toml` | Explicit saved path; unset by default | `ConfigManager.modelCacheDirectory`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ModelCacheConfiguration.swift` |
| No saved location | Unchanged `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` | `ModelScanner.homeCacheDirectory` |

**Existing providers keep the legacy cache until a location is explicitly saved,**
even when Hugging Face/XDG variables are already exported. Those variables are
not runtime cache overrides and are not forwarded into the provider LaunchAgent.
Status, inspection, menu cancellation, and upgrading do not save a location.

[`darkbloom models location`](../provider/cli-reference.md#darkbloom-models-location)
saves an absolute path from a direct argument or confirmed menu selection.
`--from-env` explicitly imports the current environment-selected directory once
and saves its concrete path. Only that import uses `ModelScanner.resolveEnvironmentCache`
with the following first-valid-value precedence:

| Import priority | Variable | Candidate directory | Reader |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `HF_HUB_CACHE` | The value itself | `ModelScanner.resolveEnvironmentCache` |
| 2 | `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE` | The value itself (legacy alias) | `ModelScanner.resolveEnvironmentCache` |
| 3 | `HF_HOME` | `<value>/hub` | `ModelScanner.resolveEnvironmentCache` |
| 4 | `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | `<value>/huggingface/hub` | `ModelScanner.resolveEnvironmentCache` |

No valid variable means the import fails without saving. Blank, NUL-containing
or unexpandable `~user` values are ignored; other paths retain significant
whitespace. The selected candidate must be an existing readable, searchable,
writable directory. A missing/unusable higher-priority path does not silently
fall through to another directory. Later environment changes never redirect a
saved path; import again explicitly if that is intended. Hugging Face tools do
not read Darkbloom's TOML key.

`--reset` removes the saved setting and restores the legacy default, regardless
of ambient variables. Hand-written relative config paths are relative to the
TOML file. Invalid saved paths fail loading; reset or an explicit valid selection
can repair them. Inspection with `--check PATH` is independent of saved config.
Missing or empty selected caches never cause fallback to another cache. Symlink
resolution preserves filesystem traversal failures rather than erasing a missing
or non-directory component before `..`.

The command never moves weights or restarts a provider. Apply a saved change with
`darkbloom restart` (or `darkbloom start` if stopped). The CLI reports its selected
config, not proof that an already-running daemon has adopted a new setting.

### Operator-facing: daemon, paths, updates

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | any value | unset | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Darkbloom.swift`; `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StartCommand+Modes.swift`; `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/WatchdogCommand.swift`; `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+AutoUpdate.swift`; forwarded by `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/WatchdogAgent.swift` | Skips the startup version banner, the in-daemon auto-update loop, the start-mode check and the watchdog's update check; `scripts/install.sh` sets it for the runtime smoke test. |
| `DARKBLOOM_AUTH_TOKEN_PATH` | file path | `~/.darkbloom/auth_token` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Auth/DeviceAuth.swift` | A nonempty explicit path replaces the token path. Without it, the token is read only from `~/.darkbloom/auth_token` (for `sudo darkbloom report`, the invoking user's, read-only through `AuthTokenStore.loadReadOnly`); there is no legacy-path fallback. |
| `DARKBLOOM_LOCAL_DIR` | directory | `~/.darkbloom` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Server/LocalEndpoint.swift` | Directory for `local_token` and `local.json` (direct mode). |
| `DARKBLOOM_STATE_FILE` | file path | `~/.darkbloom/daemon-state.json` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/DaemonStateFile.swift` | Daemon state snapshot read by `status`, `doctor` and the watchdog. |
| `DARKBLOOM_LOADED_MODELS_FILE` | file path | `~/.darkbloom/loaded-models.json` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/LoadedModelsStore.swift` | Warm-model journal. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PID_FILE` | file path | `~/.darkbloom/provider.pid` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/ProcessLifecycle.swift` | Daemon PID file. |
| `DARKBLOOM_WATCHDOG_STATE` | file path | `~/.darkbloom/watchdog-state.json` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/WatchdogState.swift` | Watchdog arm/disarm state. |
| `DARKBLOOM_KV_BACKEND_GUARD` | absolute file path | `~/.darkbloom/kv-backend-guard.json` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/KVBackendGuard.swift` | Crash-loop guard record; on the LaunchAgent allow-list so the watchdog and daemon share one file. |
| `DARKBLOOM_R2_CDN_URL` | URL | `https://models.darkbloom.ai` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Models/ModelDownloader.swift` | Mirror model weights are downloaded from. |
| `DARKBLOOM_KEYCHAIN_ACCESS_GROUP` | access group | `SLDQ2GJ6TL.io.darkbloom.provider` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Security/PersistentEnclaveKey.swift` | Keychain access group for the Secure Enclave key items. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MLX_RESOURCE_DEBUG` | `0` quiets | unset (telemetry on) | forwarded only, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/LaunchAgent.swift` | MLX resource telemetry switch consumed by `mlx-swift-lm`. |

### Engine and scheduler

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_KV` | `0` forces contiguous | unset (policy decides) | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/EngineV2KVBackendPolicy.swift` (`preferredBackend`, `killSwitchDisabled`) | Kill switch for paged KV; beats the `provider.toml` setting. The [owned Flash-Next candidate](qwen4-next-support.md#identity-and-serving-policy) joins the exact automatic policy; a default is not runtime qualification. |
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_KV_DTYPE` | `float16`, `float32` | unset: observed native per-layer types | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+BackendPreparation.swift` | Optional assertion for resolved paged storage; a nonempty value must match every measured native layer. Unsupported values or mismatches refuse explicit paged construction. |
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_SOLO_PREFILL_STRIPE` | tokens | engine default | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+Configuration.swift` | Solo-prefill stripe size. |
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_MAX_PARTIAL_PREFILLS` | integer (`0` = unlimited) | `1` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+Configuration.swift` | Maximum concurrent partial prefills. |
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_LEGACY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | affirmative | off | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+Configuration.swift` | Restores the legacy per-request timeout. |
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_MTP` | negative disables | unset (beta flag decides) | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/SpecDec/SpecDecArtifactFunnel.swift`; `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/BetaFeatures.swift` | Kill switch for MTP speculation; beats the `provider.toml` beta flag. See [`../provider/beta-features.md`](../provider/beta-features.md). |
| `DARKBLOOM_MTP_MAX_RECTANGULAR_TOKENS` | integer | policy default | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/MTP/MTPAutomaticVerificationPolicy.swift` | Tighten-only cap on rectangular MTP verification tokens. |
| `DARKBLOOM_NEMOTRON35_MTP_CAPTURE_VERIFY` | exact `0` disables | on | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/NemotronH35MTP.swift` (`requiredVerificationMode`) | Captured rectangular verification with every-prefix recurrent state; `0` uses serial target verification. Not forwarded to LaunchAgents. |
| `DARKBLOOM_NEMOTRON35_MTP_BATCHED_M1` | exact `0` disables | on | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/NemotronH35MTPExactRows.swift` (`NemotronMTPExecution`) | Batch-axis projection dispatch that retains matrix M=1. No change to target precision; not forwarded to LaunchAgents. |
| `DARKBLOOM_NEMOTRON35_MTP_KV_ONLY_HISTORY` | exact `0` disables | on | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/NemotronH35MTP.swift` (`NemotronH35MTPAssistant`) | Trusted-history replay may compute only the embedded assistant's K/V. Prefix save/restore uses the separate typed history codec. Not forwarded to LaunchAgents. |
| `DARKBLOOM_NEMOTRON35_MTP_MAX_DRAFT_TOKENS` | integer `1`…`7` | `7` | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/NemotronH35MTP.swift` (`NemotronH35MTPAssistant`) | Upper proposal limit for adaptive depth; invalid selected limits fall back to seven. This is not a fixed proposal count. Not forwarded to LaunchAgents. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MTP_VERIFICATION_MODE` | `rectangular`, `serial`, `serial_target`, `automatic` | `automatic` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/MTPProductionSession.swift` | MTP verification strategy (benchmark session). |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFILL_DEADLINE_MODE` | `off`, `enforce` | `off` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/PrefillDeadlineMode.swift` | Prefill-deadline admission on the provider. |
| `DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_CHUNK_EVAL` | integer layers | projected from `provider.toml` (`18`) | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/GemmaOptimizationEnvironment.swift` | Gemma-4 prefill chunk-eval layers; the provider sets it for the engine, `scripts/install.sh` sets `18` for the smoke test. |
| `DARKBLOOM_ENGINE_V2_VLM_PARITY_CHECK` | `0` skips | on | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Vision/EngineV2VLMTextExtraction.swift` | VLM text-extraction parity check. |

### Native Flash-Next candidate

These controls belong to the [private candidate contract](qwen4-next-support.md),
not a public catalog activation. They are read in foreground/local processes;
these model-specific controls are not forwarded by `LaunchAgent.inferencePassthroughEnvKeys`.
Installed processes still use the source defaults.

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_MODEL_PATH` | absolute existing native Qwen4 snapshot directory with config and weight index | unset; normal HF cache resolution | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCoreFoundation/Qwen4LocalModelPath.swift` (`directory`); `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCoreFoundation/ModelScanner.swift` (`resolveLocalPath`); `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Models/ModelScanner+Discovery.swift` (`scanAllModels`) | Selects an isolated directory only for exact `DarkBloom/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Q4-mtp`. Scanner and load resolution agree. An invalid explicit override hides/refuses this model instead of using its old cached snapshot; other IDs are unchanged. Normal artifact hashing, admission and runtime checks remain active. No HOME or cache mutation. |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_LISTING_CONTEXT` | positive integer, lower-only | positive native context; `262_144` fallback for the qualified IDs without metadata | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Qwen4SupportPolicy.swift` (`configuredContextTokens`, `contextLimit`) | Bounds prompt plus resolved output reservation. Unset, empty, invalid, zero and negative values retain native capacity; a positive override can only lower it. Unknown native artifacts without metadata have no invented fallback. Coordinator SLA policy and physical-memory admission remain independent. |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_PLE_SSD_OFFLOAD` | negative spellings disable the SDK mmap path | on | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/Qwen4Exp.swift` (`Qwen4ExpPLEResidency.mmapFlag`, `useMmap`) | Immutable learned PLE weights remain SSD-backed independently of request prefix caching. Keep this enabled for candidate qualification; disabling request caching does not disable PLE. |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_QSA_PARALLEL_FULL_KV` | unset or exact `1` enables; explicit `0` disables | on | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/Qwen4ExpParallelQSA.swift` (`fullKVEnabled`) | Existing parallel QK/ordered-PV path for eligible native full-KV widths 1–6. Larger prefill retains existing dispatch. Other explicit spellings stay disabled. Separate compact-KV experiments remain opt-in. |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_QSA_PARALLEL_VALUE_PARTITIONS` | `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32` | `32` for full KV; caller fallback for compact KV | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/Qwen4ExpParallelQSA.swift` (`valuePartitions`) | A valid explicit caller argument wins over the environment. Invalid explicit values retain the caller fallback. This changes scheduling, not arithmetic order, precision or MTP depth. |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_LAYER_ASYNC` | unset or exact `1` enables; explicit `0` disables | on | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/Qwen4ExpLayerSubmission.swift` (`enabled`, `plan`) | Early singleton text layer submission on valid native paged caches at widths 1–6. Media/explicit positions, wider/batched shapes and faulted or unknown caches retain the existing scheduling. Other explicit spellings stay disabled. |

### Native DiffusionGemma expert reduction

These controls affect native DiffusionGemma inference, not its weights,
denoising recipe or autoregressive MTP capability. Set overrides before starting
a foreground provider or benchmark. These variables are not forwarded by
`LaunchAgent.inferencePassthroughEnvKeys`; installed processes retain the source
default unless their own environment supplies an override.

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_EXPERT_UNSORT` | unset enables; case-insensitive `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` enable; any other explicit value disables | on for eligible inference | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/DiffusionGemmaExpertReduction.swift` (`enabled`, `eligible`, `shaderIndexFits`, `reduce`); `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/DiffusionGemmaBlocks.swift` (`DiffusionGemmaExperts.callAsFunction`) | Reuses the ordered weighted-unsort kernel for sorted BF16 outputs/weights with hidden size 2816, eight selected experts, at least 64 assignments and a matching uint32 inverse permutation on the ordinary GPU device/stream. Flattened output addresses must fit the shader's uint32 range, with checked host multiplication. Avoids materializing the restored expert-output intermediate. Training, CPU/custom streams, oversized shader indices, other shapes/dtypes and explicit rollback retain the original scatter/multiply/reduce graph. No context-capacity, sampler, attention or precision change. |
| `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_SOFT_EMBEDDING` | case-insensitive `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` enable; unset or any other value disables | off; qualification candidate | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/DiffusionGemmaSoftEmbedding.swift` (`enabled`, `eligible`, `project`) | Uses the existing non-transposed affine matrix math with a 64-row GPU tile for the 256-by-262144 soft-conditioning input and 2816-wide Q8/group64 embedding. Native BF16 inference on the ordinary GPU stream only; training, traced/retained graphs, other geometry/quantization and missing resources retain original `quantizedMM`. Input-view preparation, weights and native sampler are unchanged. |
| `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_COMPILED_SAMPLER` | exact `1` enables; unset or any other value disables | off; qualification candidate | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLMCommon/DiffusionGemmaCompiledSampler.swift` (`enabled`, `eligible`, `graph`); `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLMCommon/DiffusionGemmaSampler.swift` (`stepNative`) | Compiles native entropy/acceptance and sampling-state operations for the eligible single-row, 256-position, 262144-vocabulary FP32 path. Preserves key ordering, integer draws, exact RNG/clamp constants and validation before state mutation; arbitrary callbacks, CPU/custom streams, other geometry/storage and nondefault stability/entropy/confidence policies retain the original sampler. Request arrays are explicit inputs to bounded compiled variants. Weights, diffusion recipe and context are unchanged. Account separately for first-use compilation and warmed latency. |

The following observer affects benchmarks only, not serving dispatch.

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_DESCRIPTOR_PROBE` | exact `1` enables | off | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/DiffusionBenchmarkRouteProbe.swift` (`isEnabled`, `begin`, `end`) | Emits descriptor, DiffusionGemma weighted-reduction, soft-conditioning and compiled-sampler dispatch counts from the first iteration, then requires unchanged disarmed counters. Does not select a route or alter serving. Use exclusive ownership, report first-use latency separately and exclude that iteration from warmed comparisons. |

### Bonsai performance qualification

These SDK controls default on for eligible paths of the unchanged schema-2
Ternary Bonsai 2 27B artifact. They are not a weight conversion, MTP capability
or deployment action. Source defaults apply to foreground and daemon processes.
Set any overrides before startup; these names are not in the LaunchAgent shell
environment passthrough. See `libs/mlx-swift-lm/docs/bonsai2.md` for the
artifact contract and qualification limits.

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_BONSAI_PREFILL_CARRY_ASYNC` | unset or exact `1` enables; `0` disables | on | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/PrismHadamardPrefillCarry.swift` (`isEnabled`, `enabled`, `withScope`, `submit`) | Earlier submission of compact recurrent carry during eligible packed text prefill; native arithmetic, deferred input fills, write-fault checks and engine retirement remain unchanged. Short/decode, media positions and captured windows retain existing scheduling. Other explicit spellings remain disabled. |
| `DARKBLOOM_BONSAI_F16_CONSTANT_CACHE` | unset or exact `1` enables; `0` disables | on | `libs/mlx-swift/Source/MLXNN/Hadamard.swift` (`float16ConstantReuseEnabled`, `permitsFloat16ConstantReuse`); `libs/mlx-swift/Source/MLX/ConstantArrayCastCache.swift` (`cachedCast`) | Reuses the native FP16-to-FP32 scale/offset conversion for eligible 2-bit/group128/block1024 packed projections. Adds approximately 1.60 GB of retained constants for the selected pack; weights and native precision do not change. Descriptor/stream changes invalidate reuse; tracing falls back. Other explicit spellings remain disabled; the generic cache rollback remains effective. |

See the [matched performance report](../reports/2026-09-18-bonsai2-lossless-performance.md)
for measured gains, tradeoffs and open gates. Neither control authorizes model
uploads, catalog changes, signing or production promotion.

### Memory and media budgets

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_MLX_CACHE_LIMIT_GB` | GiB (floor 1) | `8` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/MLXMemoryGuard.swift` | MLX buffer-cache limit, applied by serving and the throughput sweep before model loading. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MLX_MEMORY_RESERVE_GB` | GiB | `provider.toml` `memory_reserve_gb` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/MLXMemoryGuard.swift` | Overrides the whole-machine memory reserve. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MEM_CAP_FRACTION` | fraction | `0.90` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/UnifiedMemoryCap.swift` | Share of unified memory the engine may address. |
| `DARKBLOOM_ACTIVATION_RESERVE_GB` | GiB (raise-only) | `5.5` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/UnifiedMemoryCap.swift` | Activation headroom kept out of the weight budget. |
| `DARKBLOOM_VISION_MAX_TOWER_PATCHES` | integer (lower-only) | model default | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Vision/VisionTowerBudget.swift` | Caps vision-tower patches. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MAX_IMAGE_MEGAPIXELS`, `DARKBLOOM_MAX_REQUEST_IMAGE_MEGAPIXELS` | megapixels | `100`, `384` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Vision/MediaIngest.swift` | Per-image and per-request pixel caps. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MAX_MEDIA_MIB` | MiB | `25` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Vision/MediaIngest.swift` | Per-request media bytes. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MAX_VIDEO_SECONDS` | seconds | `600` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Vision/MediaIngest.swift` | Per-video duration cap. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MAX_IMAGES_PER_REQUEST`, `DARKBLOOM_MAX_VIDEOS_PER_REQUEST` | integers | `16`, `8` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Vision/MediaIngest.swift` | Attachment count caps. |
| `DARKBLOOM_MAX_REQUEST_VIDEO_FRAME_MEGAPIXELS` | megapixels | `384` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Vision/MediaIngest.swift` | Per-request decoded video-frame pixel cap. |

### Model verification I/O

The default reusable-buffer reader and bounded parallel hashing change full-file
reading and scheduling, not the verified
bytes or model arithmetic. Discovery remains hash-free. Fresh pre/post-load
verification and delayed identity publication retain their existing rules.

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_EXPERIMENT_HASH_STREAM_FIRST` | Unset or `1` enables; `0` and other explicit values disable | ON when unset | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCoreFoundation/WeightHasher.swift` (`prefersStreamReader`, `hashSingleFile`) | Try the reusable-buffer InputStream reader before FileHandle; retain full SHA and all existing fallbacks. |
| `DARKBLOOM_EXPERIMENT_HASH_WORKERS` | Integers `1`, `2`, `4`; other explicit values select `1` | `4` when unset | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCoreFoundation/WeightHasher.swift` (`resolvedHashWorkers`, `hashFilesWithRelativeKey`) | Bound independent file readers per invocation by file count and the selected limit, then combine every raw digest in the original sorted-key order. Any failed file prevents a successful aggregate. |

Concurrent invocations each have their own worker bound; this is not a global
thread budget. A warm resident request that does not hash gets no direct benefit.
Leave both controls unset for the optimized default on every model. For the
original reading path and serial order, explicitly set
`DARKBLOOM_EXPERIMENT_HASH_STREAM_FIRST=0` and `DARKBLOOM_EXPERIMENT_HASH_WORKERS=1`.
The existing variable names and invalid-value fallbacks remain compatible.
The controls do not enable caches, alter attestation policy or skip load checks.

### SSD prefix cache

Internals and file format: [`ssd-kv-cache.md`](ssd-kv-cache.md).

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE` | affirmative opts in; non-affirmative nonempty disables | on for the exact cohorts in the [backend/default table](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts), including Bonsai 2 and the owned Flash-Next candidate; off otherwise | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy+Activation.swift` (`isEnabled`) | Unset/empty uses the model default. Explicit affirmative values permit other models subject to capability/identity gates; resident payloads require the separate memory opt-in. Source enablement does not prove cache restoration. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MEMORY` | affirmative (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`) | off | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy+Activation.swift` (`isMemoryEnabled`) | Explicit opt-in for both paged resident blocks and the recurrent RAM bank; global disable wins. Forwarded by LaunchAgent. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_STATS_INTERVAL_SECS` | seconds (`0` off) | `120` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy.swift` | Cadence of the local SSD stats line and typed per-store heartbeat observation; `0` omits the observation. Sample age still advances between ticks; see [telemetry](../architecture/telemetry.md#durable-prefix-cache-observations). |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_DISK_GB` | GiB | Half the currently available space; `20` if space cannot be measured | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy.swift` (`ssdDiskBudgetBytes`) | Box-wide on-disk budget across all models, with no fixed default ceiling. A valid positive override is used verbatim. The separate 20 GiB free-space write reserve still applies. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL` | affirmative | off | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCacheFactory.swift` | Allows an in-memory KEK fallback and the isolated test root. Ephemeral ciphertext cannot be reused after process exit. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_TEST_ROOT` | directory | unset | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCacheFactory.swift` | Isolated payload root, accepted only with `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL`; normally forces an ephemeral key. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_TEST_PERSISTENT_KEY` | exactly `1` | off | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCacheFactory.swift` (`forceEphemeralKey`) | Benchmark-only: use the normal persistent KEK path within an accepted test root. Fallback is still possible; the benchmark SPI defaults to requiring actual persistent mode. Not forwarded to LaunchAgents. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_SSD_TTL_SECONDS` | seconds ≤ 1800 | `1800` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCachePolicy.swift` | Entry time-to-live. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_SSD_MAX_WRITE_GB_PER_DAY` | GB/day (`0` unlimited) | `150` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCachePolicy.swift` | Write-endurance budget. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_SSD_MIN_EFFECTIVE_TOKENS` | tokens | `1024` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCachePolicy.swift` | Smallest prefix worth persisting. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_SSD_WINDOW_SIDECAR` | affirmative | off | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCachePolicy.swift` | Persists the sliding-window sidecar. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_SSD_MAX_STAGE_MB`, `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_SSD_MAX_STAGE_MS` | MiB, ms | `1024`, `1000` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCachePolicy.swift` | Attention staging byte/time caps. Complete checkpoints use the byte value as a payload-read cap; native destination plus bounded scratch is separately reserved before allocation, with no permanent RAM carve. |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_SSD_STRICT_FSYNC` | affirmative | off | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCachePolicy.swift` | `fsync` after every write. |

### Resident recurrent prefix cache

These overrides are read at slot construction in foreground/local and test
processes; neither is on the LaunchAgent environment allow-list. Both require
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MEMORY=1` first; that opt-in and the global cache switch
are forwarded to the LaunchAgent. Backend/model/assistant
eligibility, measured publication limits, and the conservative reservation after
a slot shrink are described in
[`../architecture/prefix-cache.md#resident-tiers`](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#resident-tiers).
Provider cache enablement does not enable coordinator preference; the independent
`EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_MODE` default remains `off`
(`coordinator/registry/config.go`, `ReadConfig`).

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_HYBRID_PREFIX_CACHE` | exact `0` disables | unset (eligible only after memory opt-in) | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy+Hybrid.swift` (`hybridConfig`) | Disables recurrent checkpoint retention without changing paged/SSD policy or MTP mode. |
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_HYBRID_PREFIX_BYTES` | integer bytes | `min(1 << 30, max(0, kvBytesCapacity / 8))` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy+Hybrid.swift` (`hybridConfig`) | Reservation inside the existing slot KV grant; parsed values outside `0 < bytes < kvBytesCapacity` disable the bank, malformed values use the default. |

`CBv2HybridPrefixCacheConfig` defaults to `maximumEntries = 32` and
`maximumCheckpointsPerRequest = 2`; these have no CLI environment overrides
(`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLMCommon/ContinuousBatchingV2/Prefix/HybridPrefixCacheContract.swift`).

### Benchmark, harness and tests

Ordinary teacher-forced scoring is selected by CLI input, with no new environment
variable; its required input and backend are documented in the
[CLI reference](../provider/cli-reference.md#teacher-forced-scores)
(`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/BenchmarkCommand.swift`, `teacherForcedOptionError`).

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_ARRIVAL_TOLERANCE_MS` | ms | harness default | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/ArrivalInvarianceBenchmark.swift` | Arrival-invariance tolerance. |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_FCFS_LIVE` | `1` | unset | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/SchedulerPrefillDecisionCLI.swift` | Enables the live Qwen FCFS harness. |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_FCFS_MODEL_PATH`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_FCFS_MODEL_ID`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_FCFS_EXPECTED_MODEL_HASH`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_FCFS_SOURCE_SHA`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_FCFS_ITERATIONS`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_FCFS_KV_BACKEND`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_FCFS_OUTPUT` | strings | unset | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/SchedulerPrefillDecisionCLI.swift` | Harness inputs. |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN_MTP_SERIAL` | affirmative | off | `provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/Fixtures/Qwen38ProductionCanarySupport.swift` (tests only) | Forces serial MTP verification in the Qwen canary. |

### Retired (parsed only to warn)

`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Config.swift` recognises these and logs a warning; they have no effect: `DARKBLOOM_ENGINE_V2`, `DARKBLOOM_ENGINE_V2_MODELS`, `DARKBLOOM_COMPILED_DECODE`, `DARKBLOOM_GEMMA_B1_FAST_PATH`, `DARKBLOOM_B1_GREEDY_FAST_PATH`, `DARKBLOOM_KV_GPTOSS_KERNEL`, `DARKBLOOM_ADAPTIVE_PREFILL_ALLOW_8192`, `DARKBLOOM_KV_CAPTURE_MAX_INFLIGHT`, `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MIN_PERSIST_TOKENS`. Six more names appear only in comments because `mlx-swift-lm` reads them, not the provider (`DARKBLOOM_CBV2_ATTN_QUERY_BLOCK`, `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_PTOK_TARGET`, `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_COMPILED`, `DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_TAIL_ROWS`, `DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_LAST_QUERY`, `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_MIXED_PREFILL_CAP`); none is on the LaunchAgent allow-list, so they only apply under `start --foreground`.

### Non-`DARKBLOOM_` variables the provider honours

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MLX_GEMMA4_FUSED_WEIGHTED_UNSORT` | flag | set by the provider | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/GemmaOptimizationEnvironment.swift`; `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ServeRuntimePreparer.swift` | Provider-set MLX fused-unsort switch for Gemma 4. |
| `MLX_GATHER_QMM_EXPERT_SLICES` | `1` (drain) or config-backed `0`/`trust` | `trust` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/GemmaOptimizationEnvironment.swift`; `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/PackagedRuntimeSmoke.swift` | Expert-slice route mode; only an exact `1` is persisted into the LaunchAgent plist. |
| `SUDO_UID` | uid | set by `sudo` | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Fan/FanServiceManager.swift` | Resolves the invoking user when `darkbloom fan` runs under `sudo`. |
| `SUDO_USER` | user name | set by `sudo` | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Diagnostics/ReportAppAttestEvidence.swift` | Under `sudo darkbloom report`, selects the invoking user's state, config and read-only canonical token lookup instead of root's; explicit config/token overrides retain precedence. |
| `GITHUB_SHA` | commit | unset | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/SchedulerPrefillDecisionCLI.swift` | Fallback source SHA in benchmark reports. |
| `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`, `MallocStackLogging`, `MallocStackLoggingNoCompact`, `MallocScribble`, `MallocGuardEdges`, `MallocLogFile`, `MallocErrorAbort`, `NSZombieEnabled`, `OBJC_DEBUG_POOL_ALLOCATION`, `CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS` | — | — | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Security/EnvironmentScrubber.swift` | Removed from the daemon's environment at start; reported as the `env_scrubbed` capability. |

`scripts/install.sh` additionally reads `COORD_URL` (substituted by the coordinator when it serves `/install.sh`; required when the script is run from source), `HOME` (install root `$HOME/.darkbloom`), `TMPDIR` (enrollment-profile temp dir only) and the two code-signing requirement constants `DARKBLOOM_DESIGNATED_REQUIREMENT` and `DARKBLOOM_FAN_HELPER_REQUIREMENT`. See [`../provider/installation.md`](../provider/installation.md).

## console-ui

All variables are inlined at build time.

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_COORDINATOR_URL` | URL | `https://api.darkbloom.dev` | `console-ui/src/lib/server/coordinator.ts` (`coordinatorUrl`); `console-ui/src/lib/coordinator-url.ts` (`PUBLIC_COORDINATOR_URL`) | Upstream coordinator for every proxy route and for client-side display; a browser can override it via the `darkbloom_coordinator_url` localStorage key. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` | Privy app id | `""` | `console-ui/src/components/app-providers/PrivyClientProvider.tsx` | Unset or the literal `placeholder` selects mock auth (always authenticated, no token); otherwise the real Privy provider. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | `G-…` | `G-M65PNVW5TE` (only `undefined` falls back; set `""` to disable) | `console-ui/src/lib/google-analytics.ts` | Google Analytics page-view tracking after consent. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DD_APPLICATION_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DD_CLIENT_TOKEN` | Datadog RUM credentials | unset (RUM off) | `console-ui/src/components/DatadogRUM.tsx` | Both must be set for RUM to initialise. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DD_SITE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DD_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` | strings | `datadoghq.com`, `production`, `dev` | `console-ui/src/components/DatadogRUM.tsx` | RUM site, env and version tags. |
| `NODE_ENV` | set by Next | — | `console-ui/src/app/stats/model-brand.ts` | Suppresses unknown-brand console warnings in production. |
| `SHARED_BUDGET_KB`, `ROUTE_BUDGET_KB` | KiB | `450`, `650` | `console-ui/scripts/analyze-bundle.mjs` | Bundle-size budgets for the build analysis script (not runtime). |

## admin-ui

Server-only runtime variables. See [`../architecture/components/admin-ui.md`](../architecture/components/admin-ui.md).

| Variable | Values / type | Default | Read in | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN_DB_URL` | Postgres DSN (secret) | required; pool creation throws | `admin-ui/src/lib/db.ts` | Read-only replica connection; `sslmode`/`ssl` query parameters are stripped and SSL is configured programmatically. |
| `ADMIN_DB_SSL_NO_VERIFY` | `true` | unset (certificates verified) | `admin-ui/src/lib/db.ts` | Accepts self-signed replica certificates. |
| `ADMIN_BASIC_USER`, `ADMIN_BASIC_PASS` | credentials (secret) | required; auth fails closed | `admin-ui/src/lib/auth.ts`, enforced by `admin-ui/src/proxy.ts` | HTTP Basic credentials compared as constant-time SHA-256 digests. |
| `NODE_ENV` | set by Next | — | `admin-ui/src/lib/db.ts` | Outside `production` the pool is cached on `globalThis` for hot reload. |

## GPT-OSS performance controls

These library controls apply to foreground processes and benchmark runs; they are not added to the provider LaunchAgent environment allow-list. Prefix reuse is independent of these changes.

| Variable | Values | Default | Reader and effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_GPTOSS_PREFILL_OUTPUT` | `full`, `intermediate`, `last`, `last-layer` | `last` | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/GPTOSS+PrefillOutput.swift` (`GPTOSSPrefillOutputPolicy`): skip unused intermediate vocabulary projections and project only the final hidden position. `full` restores full projections; `intermediate` preserves the final full-shape head; `last-layer` additionally narrows the last full-attention layer when its cache supports it. |
| `DARKBLOOM_GPTOSS_FUSED_GATE_UP` | `0` disables; otherwise enabled | enabled for hidden/intermediate width 2880 and 32 experts | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/GPTOSS.swift` (`useFusedGateUp`): concatenate compatible gate/up checkpoint rows. Conflicting quantization policies remain split; incremental materialization bounds the added load transient. |
| `MLX_QUANTIZED_CONSTANT_CACHE` | `0`, `false`, `no`, `off` disable | enabled | `libs/mlx-swift/Source/MLX/ConstantArrayCastCache.swift` (`ConstantArrayCastCache`): bounded reuse of unchanged BF16-to-FP32 constants; updates invalidate and transforms bypass reuse. |
| `MLX_GPTOSS_MXFP4_DECODE_FAST_TAIL` | `1` enables, other explicit values disable | enabled only on physical `applegpu_g16s` | `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/backend/metal/quantized.cpp` (`gather_qmv`): width-2880 MXFP4 gathered matrix-vector path with a masked 320-element tail. Exact shape/dtype gates retain the general fallback. |
| `MLX_GPTOSS_MXFP4_PREFILL_TILE` | `m32n32k32`; other values use legacy | legacy | `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/backend/metal/gptoss_mxfp4_policy.h` (`gptoss_mxfp4_prefill_tile`): optional 32-row tile for matching sorted expert prefill shapes. Small workstation gains do not establish a universal default. |
| `DARKBLOOM_GPTOSS_COMPILED_EXPERTS` | `1` enables | disabled | `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/GPTOSS+CompiledExperts.swift` (`GPTOSSCompiledExpertsPolicy`): compile single-token B=1/2/4 expert graphs for exact 20B shapes. The global `MLX_COMPILED_DECODE=0` rollback still disables this path. Batch-dependent timing is mixed; weights remain live through weak updatable state. |
