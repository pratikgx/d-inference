# Test

> Last updated: 2026-09-28 · commit `d89ef42be`

How to run the unit tests for each component, the end-to-end suite that boots a
real coordinator + Swift provider against ephemeral Postgres, and the docs
lint — and which CI workflow runs what. `make test` runs every unit suite plus
the docs lint locally; CI runs a subset per pull request (see the CI workflow
map: the benchmark-wrapper tests run only locally). The e2e suite needs an Apple Silicon
Mac with the test checkpoints cached.

The Nemotron coordinator-serving path uses typed SDK events. `OpenAIServiceTests`
and `ToolCallParserIntegrationTests` in `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Tests/MLXLMServerTests`
check SSE/collected reasoning, content, tool calls, usage and terminals without
starting a localhost server. `MutableInputKernelTests` and
`MutableInputExportTests` in the SDK's `Tests/OnboardingQualificationTests`
exercise declared Metal writes, alias ownership and export/import. CI runs each
selected suite through the nonzero/no-skip wrapper
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/run-nested-suite.sh`).

For HF artifact downloads, `HuggingFaceDownloadTests` covers source preference,
checksum rejection, fallback, and cancellation. Native Nemotron CI also runs
`NemotronHTests`, `NemotronH35BackendParityTests`, `NemotronH35StorageParityTests`,
`NemotronH35MTPTests`, and `NemotronH35MTPPrimingTests` with nonzero/no-skip guards.
The MTP tests cover native paged storage, typed durable prefix history, rollback,
and teardown; `CBv2QwenMTPIntegrationTests` independently covers allocation-refusal
ownership in the shared engine. Loaded-artifact tests remain an additional gate,
not evidence supplied by tiny fixtures. `scripts/test-publish-model.sh`
checks the artifact workflow payload. `TestHuggingFaceArtifactPostgresAndCache`
in `coordinator/store/hugging_face_artifact_test.go` uses a disposable
`DATABASE_URL` to check storage and cache invalidation.

`ProductionPromptParityTests` drives the real model-free `MLXOpenAIService`
preparation seam before tokenization. The shared public corpus covers JSON-object
and schema response formats plus multi-system and text/tool/endpoint forms; it compares
actual Swift tokens and scope-bound hashes with Rust plans. No production
prompts or model weights are needed (`scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh`).

For the DiffusionGemma live gates, use the immutable public checkpoint:

```bash
hf download mlx-community/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-4bit \
  --revision a7a81407613811e8ba63af92ac0d852b809e191f
export DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_MODEL_DIR="$HOME/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-4bit/snapshots/a7a81407613811e8ba63af92ac0d852b809e191f"
(cd provider-swift && swift build --build-tests)
./scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh "$(cd provider-swift && swift build --show-bin-path)"
(cd provider-swift && DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_ENCRYPTED_LIVE=1 DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE=0 \
  ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh nativeTextToolsMediaAndHistoryCrossTheEncryptedWire --no-parallel)
```

The encrypted provider gate and SDK portable-state gate share
`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Tests/MLXLMTests/DiffusionGemmaArtifactFixture.swift`
(`DiffusionGemmaArtifactFixture.verify`). It pins the file inventory, sizes and
SHA-256 checksums from that revision and streams the actual bytes, including
processor and generation metadata. HF snapshot symlinks are supported; missing,
modified or additional files fail verification. No private local verification
receipt is required. The provider imports the same test helper through a source
symlink; it does not change startup scanning or production attestation.

`scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh` first calls the source-verifying metallib builder,
then replaces both the executable-colocated library and the nested test resource
used for cache identity. Use it after rebuilding either Swift package's tests.
The Make target and CI use this shared setup. The native cancellation fixture
resolves `localhost` and tries its address families; its hermetic socket test
covers separate IPv4 and IPv6 listeners.

For a new native family, run the same production corpus against its exact
config/tokenizer/template artifacts before accepting cache routing. Diffusion
controls are mirrored by `coordinator/promptsidecar/src/diffusion.rs`; its tests
cover positive effort, explicit boolean precedence, absence and invalid efforts.
`DiffusionGemmaPromptParityLiveTests` can isolate the real artifact's tool-turn
shape without loading weights. `DiffusionGemmaMediaNormalizationTests` checks
that media follows the same input formatter without losing decoded assets or
enabling AR grammar. Keep renderer/prompt parity distinct from generation quality.

`DiffusionToolResultMediaTests` verifies decoded tool-result pixels and symbolic
placeholder order against actual call IDs, including reversed result arrival,
unsupported-role refusals and legacy isolation. `NativeMediaToolsCapabilityTests`
covers family-scoped advertisement plus ordinary/attested registration and model
updates. Go `TestNativeMediaTools` cases cover model updates/revocation, final
reservation, aliases, owner routing, retry exclusions and queued media-result
requests without forced choice. Run these before actual encrypted coordinator
media/tool fixtures; component passes do not establish generated tool quality.

`TestLowerResponsesInstructions` runs the same shared instruction vectors through
serving and cache lowering. `TestResponsesInlineMediaReachesEncryptedProviderInOrder`
combines instructions with ordered user and tool-result media in both transport
modes. `TestResponsesInstructionsAdmissionEstimates` checks pre-lowering routing
and billing bounds. When this contract changes, regenerate the current full
production corpus from its immutable manifests and verify independent Swift
tokenizer/template parity; do not replace a current corpus with older PR fixtures.

`DiffusionGemmaTokenizerParityLiveTests` compares the actual local tokenizer
against an independently produced synthetic oracle without loading weights.
Enable `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_TOKENIZER_PARITY=1`, set
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_TOKENIZER_DIR` to the verified tokenizer directory and
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_TOKENIZER_ORACLE` to the retained oracle JSON. The oracle
contains 16 entries with `text`, `tokenIds`, `decoded` and
`decodedSkippingSpecial`; compare exact UTF-8 bytes, not Unicode-equivalent
Swift strings. The SDK has the matching `DiffusionGemmaTokenizerLiveTests` gate.
Keep encoding, decoding and model semantic quality verdicts distinct.

`DiffusionGemmaRawCaseLiveTests` replays retained synthetic API fixtures through
the same native prompt contract and records output before reasoning/tool parsing.
Its explicit `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_RAW_CASE_DIAGNOSTIC` opt-in requires the selected
artifact and `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_RAW_CASES_DIR`; run it alone under an external
memory/time guard. Keep raw diagnostics private. Fixed diagnostic seeds do not
reproduce an earlier unseeded API failure, and successful execution is not a
semantic-quality pass. Never repair literal arguments merely to satisfy a fixture.

`DiffusionGemmaFourCallDiagnosticLiveTests` uses the existing DEBUG-only native
text observer during a bounded set of actual authenticated HTTP requests. Its
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_FOUR_CALL_DIAGNOSTIC` opt-in records every new unseeded
trajectory and compares parsing of original chunks with their concatenation.
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_FOUR_CALL_CASE` selects only `responses-four-on-stream`
(the default) or `responses-four-on-plain` from the retained synthetic directory.
The test checks the fixture's case and transport flag, records its receipt hash,
and keeps the same fixed sixteen-trial budget. Unknown names and traversal are
rejected by `DiffusionGemmaFourCallFixtureTests`; selecting a plain fixture must
not be represented as streaming coverage or replay of the original random draw.
It retains failures and checks drain between requests; it is not retry-until-pass
qualification or an exact replay of an earlier unrecorded random seed. Raw text
and response captures remain private and are never production telemetry.
`NativeToolStreamRouterTests` separately proves that four complete native frames
remain four calls, while four starts with only one closing marker fail closed
across chunk boundaries. A permissive parser returning one call is not a passing
four-call result; do not silently repair the omitted protocol markers.

`DiffusionGemmaNamedToolDiagnosticLiveTests` adds a fixed four-round matrix of
retained named-tool Responses requests, reasoning on/off and plain/streaming.
Its `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_NAMED_TOOL_DIAGNOSTIC=1` opt-in uses the same model and
synthetic case-directory inputs. It captures native chunks before parsing and
compares joined/chunked parser outcomes, with a bounded drain after every request.
Successful diagnostic collection is not a tool-quality pass. Keep both earlier
unseeded failures and every newly captured outcome; never retry until green.

`DiffusionGemmaReasoningEmissionTests` deterministically replays the captured
unclosed-thought shape through the provider adapter without loading weights.
It requires failure without exposing disabled reasoning or invoking the embedded
tool, at fragmented and whole-chunk boundaries. It also preserves enabled
reasoning, empty envelopes and literal markers in arguments, and verifies that a
failed router cannot resume. `DiffusionGemmaReasoningControlTests` compares output
permission against the renderer's Boolean/effort precedence. These component
checks complement, but do not replace, actual model and HTTP qualification.
The same suite sends the scripted captured output through the real shared local
HTTP application on a loopback socket, covering both APIs and stream modes. It
checks authentication before submission, sanitized failure terminals, absence of
disabled thought/tool bytes and the unchanged forced-tool 422 classification.
This transport fixture is not live model-generation evidence.

For media-cache deadline attribution only,
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_MEDIA_TRACE_ROOT` points to a new private directory for exact
synthetic image/video request bodies. `DiffusionGemmaMediaPrefixLiveTests` records
phase timings and preserves its original client deadline and assertions. The
export excludes authentication headers and weights. A later quiet pass does not
erase an earlier cold timeout; compare the captured request on the actual
optimized CLI and keep diagnostic versus normal-gate results separate.

`DiffusionLongContextLiveTests` exercises repeated contiguous and paged requests
through the normal native benchmark factory, including load-hash brackets and
shared memory admission. Enable `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_LONG_CONTEXT_LIVE=1`, point
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_MODEL_DIR` at the verified selected artifact, and choose one
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_CONTEXT_TOKENS` value per guarded process. It defaults to
4096; larger cells require a fresh physical-memory/headroom check. Prompts retain
complete chat framing and are sized using the actual tokenizer. Require exact
output equality, the known-answer oracle and post-retirement owner release.
The `262016` target reserves the artifact's remaining output capacity so the
actual prompt plus requested output equals its native context exactly; it does
not claim that many input tokens alone or suppress an early native EOS.
The short answer measures long prefill/state correctness, not sustained decode
or finalized-visible-token performance. Its MLX peak includes loading; preserve
the external physical-footprint trace separately. A SwiftPM helper is a distinct
executable from its test bundle: runtime identity requires the source-matched
Metal library beside the actual test host, without modifying the installed
toolchain or bypassing production binding.
The native benchmark installs the same `MLXMemoryGuard.configureOnce` policy
as serving before loading. The fixture asserts the actual allocator limits;
do not use MLX's uncapped default pool as a production memory baseline.

`DiffusionVisibleThroughputLiveTests` measures sustained finalized visible output
through the same native factory. Enable `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_VISIBLE_BENCH_LIVE=1`
with the verified `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_MODEL_DIR`. It runs three 2,048-token-output
iterations per contiguous/paged backend with the unchanged native canvas and
sampler. Require equal original token IDs across repeats, sufficient visible
output, and post-retirement release. The metric excludes initial protocol framing
only at a proved original-token boundary and includes first-block generation;
it does not count refinement work or retokenize displayed text. Run its metric
helper tests as well, including literal markers and malformed framing. Inspect
the generated synthetic text separately: a valid rate/equality result is not a
quality pass or proof of the performance target. Retain all iteration timings,
exact build configuration and source/resource identities.

The ordinary native benchmark can emit the
[descriptor-route diagnostic](../reference/configuration.md#native-diffusiongemma-expert-reduction).
Run it only with an idle, exclusively owned model process. The first iteration
observes core descriptor dispatch, DiffusionGemma weighted reduction and
soft-conditioning projection and compiled-sampler dispatch; later
iterations require the disarmed counters to remain unchanged. All iterations
remain in benchmark output, so exclude the first from performance comparisons.
`DiffusionBenchmarkRouteProbeTests` checks explicit activation, warmup/order,
changed counters and invalid boundaries without loading a model. This observer
does not change requested routing or establish numerical/API qualification.
The SDK's `DiffusionGemmaSoftEmbeddingTests` covers explicit activation,
geometry/device/training exclusions, compile/grad/JVP/vmap guards, exact fallback
computation and counter arming/retirement. Full-weight qualification separately
compares both conditioning formats, complete raw logits/state and original
committed output. A projection-only timing is not a model or provider speedup.
`DiffusionGemmaNativeSamplerTests` checks fallback controls and request-local key
ordering. Its bounded GPU regression requires both
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_SAMPLER_NUMERICAL_EDGE_LIVE=1` and the compiled-sampler switch
from the configuration reference. It exercises near-uniform categorical draws
at an extreme finite temperature without loading model weights. Preserve exact
integer, uniform/Gumbel, state and committed-output checks; equal seeds alone
do not establish unchanged sampling. Full serving, first-use and memory gates
remain separate from that regression.

`DiffusionGemmaConcurrencyLiveTests` compares native mixed text, reasoning
OFF/ON tools and image cohorts with isolated responses, requiring actual native
overlap at widths two and four. It also tests quiet socket-reset cancellation,
survivor equality and retained-old-bridge unload/reload. The existing short-prompt
cell can finish a row before media preparation admits the fourth; preserve any
missed-width result rather than treating four launched tasks as proof. The
separate `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_UNCACHED_PREFILL_COHORT_LIVE=1` cell requires cacheOFF
and matched prompts over1,024tokens to sustain overlap. It retains the same
four-way criterion, native execution and deadlines, and records HTTP start/finish
and sampled native-active transitions. Neither cell proves fused GPU batching.

`DiffusionGemmaStopLiveTests` separately checks authenticated Chat HTTP and SSE
on paged storage, with a known-answer control and a caller stop inside that
answer. It requires `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_STOP_HTTP_LIVE=1` and the same selected
artifact locator. Require clipped content, reduced completion usage, matching
stream/nonstream usage, one terminal and released request reservations. SDK
`NativeBlockEngineTests` provides the independent original-token accounting
oracle for same-block/cross-block stops, Unicode, cleanup, EOS and cancellation.

Child-executable fixtures resolve only the running test configuration through
`LiveInferenceFixtures.buildProduct`: native SwiftPM `debug`/`release` and
SwiftBuild `Debug`/`Release` are supported without borrowing a peer build.
`LiveInferenceMetallibSourceTests` covers both layouts and rejects unknown or
escaping paths. Stage all declared resources in the consumer's expected layout,
including Qwen4 Metal headers, before running the real child `runtime-smoke` and
`SelfUpdaterTests`. Resource discovery is distinct from model inference; local
ad-hoc signed fixtures do not establish release signing or production attestation.

Installer onboarding regression coverage runs with `scripts/test-install-atomic.sh`.
The provider CI job runs `python3 scripts/test-profile-inventory-auth.py` on macOS. Its pseudo-terminal fixtures compile the production profile-inventory helper, verify foreground password prompting without echo, exercise nonzero exits and failed spawns in a foreground terminal, and reject background terminal jobs and noninteractive reads without invoking real `sudo` or changing profiles.
It invokes `scripts/test-install-onboarding.py`, which executes the actual setup
function with profile/network/Settings effects mocked: macOS 27+, older and unknown
versions, existing management, and unavailable enrollment. This checks setup
routing only; signed Mac App Attest qualification is separate.

Build qualification regressions run in `coordinator/store/app_attest_builds_test.go`, `coordinator/appattest/service/build_qualifications_test.go`, `coordinator/api/app_attest_builds_test.go`, and `coordinator/api/app_attest_builds_auth_test.go`. The route tests validate real ES256 Privy JWTs through the mux, server-attributed audit actors, and rejection of admin-owned inference keys. The real PostgreSQL contract requires a **disposable** `DATABASE_URL` (the harness truncates test tables). Test memory/decorated/Postgres persistence, conflicting identities, publish/revoke races, cache fencing, lease expiry and reload; run the affected Go packages with `-race`. `python3 scripts/test-provider-release-publication.py` tests blocked publication, immutable artifacts, retained-byte R2 staging retries across workflow attempts, literal tag-note preservation and recovery after draft creation, interrupted upload, completed upload and publication failures without credentials or live writes; CI runs it with `scripts/test-provider-release-pipeline.py`. The annotated-tag fixture supplies its own commit/tag identity with global and system Git configuration disabled, so a developer account cannot mask missing CI setup. These checks do not replace final signed-Mac/Apple qualification.

## Provider lifecycle regression checks

Serving measurements and profile admission have focused suites
`EngineEarlyPerformanceTests`, `EngineV2PrefillSamplingTests`,
`ServingPerformanceProfileTests` and the shared profiler-wire fixture. Run the
ordinary provider test target as well as dependency tests for
`CBv2RequestTimingTests`, `NativeBlockEngineTests` and
`CBv2MixedStepPrefillQuotaTests` after changing the CBv2 pin. The Go registry
suite covers accepted counter deltas, stale/replayed observations, shared
service admission, warm-load ownership and transport freshness.

`make benchmark-wrapper-test` also runs the offline serving-profile evaluator
regressions. For real hardware coverage and required evidence, follow
[serving performance qualification](serving-performance-qualification.md).
Synthetic tests never certify M5 concurrency or a mixed-prefill default.
Calibrated admission adds `DeadlineCalibrationTests`, `PromptWorkTests`, the
shared calibrated-capacity fixture, and SDK `CBv2CalibratedFirstContentTests`.
Go and Swift also consume the same synthetic deadline-decision fixture for
cache reuse, existing-owner bounds, live-rate ceilings and the remaining clock;
it tests arithmetic agreement and does not qualify hardware.
`coordinator/api/promptwork` tests body/model memoization, original-clock planner
bounds and measured shape restrictions. The optional API corpus projection
uses the production heuristic and writes numeric data only; the qualification
guide documents its environment variables and paired tokenizer run.

Run `make provider-test` to build tests and install the source-matched Metal
library beside the runner. Focused suites include `ProviderLifecycleTests`,
`LifecycleMailboxTests`, `ServiceDrainTests`, `LocalResponseTrackerTests`,
`CoordinatorLifecycleBarrierTests`, `ProviderSignalTests`, and
`AutoUpdateLifecycleOverlapTests`. They cover accepted concurrent/cold work,
slow final writes, expiry, force, command interruption, update overlap, process
identity, wire ordering, unsupported acknowledgements and real-process SIGTERM.

The isolated launchd integration is opt-in on a logged-in macOS session:

```bash
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_LAUNCHD_TESTS=1 swift test --skip-build --filter LaunchAgentDrainIntegrationTests
```

It uses a unique temporary GUI-domain label and plist, never the installed
provider/watchdog. `TestProviderDrainAckFollowsUsageSettlementAndKeepsControlTrafficAlive`
in `coordinator/api/provider_drain_barrier_test.go` runs both streaming and
non-streaming traffic against the actual coordinator, delays asynchronous
settlement, sends duplicate terminals, and verifies one usage record before
acknowledgement. Run it and the dispatch/drain tests with Go's race detector.

Release qualification still requires a Developer ID-signed installed provider
against real coordinator traffic, with App Attest or legacy authorization. A
unit test, simulated provider, ad-hoc signature or green CI is not that evidence.


## Bonsai performance qualification

The default-on eligible profile is documented in
`libs/mlx-swift-lm/docs/bonsai2.md`. Record unset/default, explicit `1` and
explicit `0` process profiles separately; an unset control is no longer OFF.
Unchanged weights and equal greedy tokens do not replace independent raw-logit
and native-state comparisons. `Float16ConstantCastTests` and
`PrismPrefillCarryPolicyTests` cover absent/explicit/invalid overrides;
`PrismPrefillCarrySubmissionTests` runs the real scheduling, fault and retirement
checks in both unset/default and explicit-ON processes with its GPU/witness opt-ins.

`BonsaiEncryptedCheckpointLiveTests` requires the verified unchanged artifact
and an exclusively owned GPU lane. Select it separately from other live model
suites; its gate is `DARKBLOOM_BONSAI2_LIVE_MODEL` plus
`DARKBLOOM_BONSAI2_EXCLUSIVE_GPU=1`. It prepares actual image/tool/video inputs,
checks native three-row joins/shrink/cancellation against isolated tokens, then
uses the production paged factory and encrypted complete-checkpoint store for
cold/hot, same-process reopen, tenant/prefix misses and corrupted-ciphertext
recomputation. Its random fixture key/root do not touch Keychain or production
cache data and do not qualify signed persistence or hosted routing.

```sh
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_BONSAI2_LIVE_MODEL=/absolute/path/to/verified-artifact \
DARKBLOOM_BONSAI2_EXCLUSIVE_GPU=1 \
DARKBLOOM_BONSAI_PREFILL_CARRY_ASYNC=1 \
DARKBLOOM_BONSAI_F16_CONSTANT_CACHE=1 \
swift test --build-system native -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing \
  -Xswiftc -DDEBUG --filter BonsaiEncryptedCheckpointLiveTests --no-parallel
```

These are qualification instructions, not a claim that an unrun gate passed.
Use a separate test build, its adjacent resource bundles and exact matching
Metal library, and an owned-process memory/time guard. The ordinary production
binary must also pass the final local Chat/Responses, reasoning/tool/history and
multimodal API matrix. Keep the final local OpenRouter-compatible weather/tool
gate distinct from any unavailable hosted certification.

`LocalOutputTokenLimitTests` checks the complete provider-local responder stack,
not only the SDK router: authenticated intercepted chat aliases/batches and
routed Completions/Responses must preserve the SDK's early HTTP 400 before
model acquisition, while missing authentication still returns 401.
`NativeToolStreamRouterTests` includes Bonsai's explicit nested-reasoning policy
and opaque XML string arguments. Its policy must be wired for both text and
media, with other families unchanged. Do not "repair" generated quoted strings
by guessing JSON unescaping; the published template renders string parameters
as raw values. Keep model copying quality separate from transport fidelity.

`LocalStreamingFailureTests` also exercises the authenticated chat-upload
interceptor, not just the SDK routes. A failure after HTTP headers must finish
with a sanitized SSE error event, without a success terminal or fabricated tool
call. The SDK's `ChatStreamingFailureHTTPTests` covers Chat/Completions framing,
observed-only usage, cancellation and the unchanged direct-service throwing
contract. Successful tool-generation gates remain separate: a correctly framed
error does not satisfy a required tool call or repair its generated arguments.

## Model revision validation

Model revision changes are covered by `ModelPrefetchDownloaderTests`,
`ModelRevisionActivationTests`, `ModelRevisionPublicationTests`, and the existing MTP drain suites in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests`. Run them with a source-matched metallib.
Coordinator lifecycle tests cover memory/cached stores and, when `DATABASE_URL`
points to a disposable database, `TestPostgresModelRevisionLifecycle`.
`python3 scripts/test_publish_model_revision.py` tests publication ordering,
immutable reservations and per-revision HF arguments/request bodies. API and
store regressions cover retired re-registration, publisher attribution, failed
live refresh retries and alias-lineage eligibility; HF download fixtures change
the pinned repo/commit/subdirectory between two revisions. Renamed-file fixtures
exercise equal aggregates through both download paths, and controlled reserve/client
suspensions verify cancellation, rollback, pending alias cleanup and retry. These
fixture tests do not qualify a full-weight fleet swap.


## SDK 27 release qualification

The `qualify-sdk` job in `.github/workflows/release-swift.yml` runs production
prompt parity and `scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` through the same SDK 27 / Swift
6.4 wrapper used by optimized compilation. The two jobs run concurrently on
separate runners; the signing job requires both to succeed. Native GPU tests keep
their existing serial execution and exclusive-process isolation within the
qualification job. A cache hit never skips a test or authorizes publication.

`Qwen4StandaloneAdmissionTests` uses `ScriptedProviderMemory` through
`StandaloneServer`'s `kvBudgetForTesting` initializer. Its synthetic models test
architecture admission, pending-load reservations and cleanup without depending
on the runner's available RAM. The low-headroom case still executes the real
admission check, refuses before weight loading, verifies cleanup, then restores
simulated headroom and retries on the same server. Physical memory and native
allocator tests retain real measurements; fixture success does not qualify the
full Flash-Next model.

The SSD write-behind pipeline tests in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/KVCacheSSD/BoundedSingleConsumerPipelineTests.swift`
cover reusable drains, bounded retention, overflow, cancellation and shutdown.
`pipelineShutdownDrainReleasesLastPayload` repeats the final-payload handoff
10,000 times: after shutdown, drain must wait for the consumer task to finish,
not just for its pending count to reach zero. This catches the payload-release
race that failed the 0.9.6 SDK qualification run. These pipeline source/test
changes also trigger both SDK 27 PR lanes.

Run the focused fixtures and the CPU-only pipeline checks before a release:

```bash
cd provider-swift
swift test --filter Qwen4StandaloneAdmissionTests --no-parallel
swift test --filter pipeline --no-parallel
cd ..
python3 scripts/test-provider-release-cache.py
python3 scripts/test-prepare-metal-toolchain.py
python3 scripts/test-provider-release-pipeline.py
python3 scripts/test-provider-signing-validation.py
```

The cache tests cover compatibility boundaries and content-checked source
mtime replay. Metal setup tests simulate delayed registration, explicit import,
command failure and timeout without installing components. The pipeline checks pin independent build/test dependencies,
signing approval, same-run source-bound artifact transfer, and checks that still
run on cache hits. The existing archive tests reject changed inventory, wrong
source, unsafe members and mismatched entitlements. CI's Release Integrity job
runs these CPU-only checks; the SDK 27 release preparation workflow additionally
runs both native lanes on release-plumbing PRs and round-trips the real unsigned
archive through the same source/inventory verifier used before signing.

## Native Flash-Next candidate

The [candidate reference](../reference/qwen4-next-support.md#validation-status-and-next-gates)
records completed local checks and remaining gates. The following are commands
for a prepared checkout, not claims that this composed candidate has passed
them. Use the [exact dependency/build prerequisites](build.md#native-flash-next-candidate).

For a merge-only dependency repin, verify the merged commit contains the
approved head and compare their complete Git trees. Record the locked consumer
build and documentation checks separately from model execution. Identical
source does not turn an earlier model receipt into a new binary or hardware
run, and it does not close an outstanding performance or lifecycle finding.

The [Qwen 3.8 Next reproducibility scripts](../../scripts/qwen38_validation/README.md)
exercise an existing loopback release server across MTP OFF/ON, reasoning
OFF/ON, Chat/Responses tools/history, unsupported-effort HTTP 400 boundaries and
isolated ephemeral complete-cache lifecycle checks. The same page gives the
separate real-state and quiet-cancellation/reload Swift opt-ins and their limits.
These local fixtures do not qualify a hosted OpenRouter route or authorize
model uploads, signing or production changes.

Build release test targets with testable imports enabled where the toolchain
requires it (`-Xswiftc -enable-testing`); do not exclude those tests to bypass a
test-build configuration error.

The SDK's `CBv2HiddenResourceTests` covers hidden generated bundles and retained
byte-conflict refusal. Run it together with the existing `CBv2PagedSafetyTests`
and actual layer-submission safety tests on the target hardware; file presence
and build success do not establish resource eligibility in the running process.
The original128-GiB reload gate must retain its normal required headroom even
when background applications prevent the first load. Record that refusal,
resolve the actual machine conditions and keep any separately labelled
diagnostic distinct from the unchanged gate.

Keep all precision controls in receipts. A diagnostic `MLX_ENABLE_TF32=0`
run on NAX hardware is not the default posture and cannot erase an earlier
default-run failure or authorize changing other models' serving behavior.
Unqualified prefill experiments are excluded from this support update.

`FlashNextReclaimDiagnostics` is a separately selected, opt-in observation of
Metal allocation, MLX active/cache, complete native charge/coverage and OS
footprint after the real quiet-prefill lifecycle. It requires
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_RECLAIM_DIAGNOSTIC=1`, exclusive GPU ownership and the same
artifact/offload/cache configuration as the ordinary lifecycle fixture. Its
observation interval is not a fix or a release gate: the original
`FlashNextQuietCancellationReloadLiveTests` still retries immediately, with no
callback/delay or lowered memory requirement. Keep both outcomes separately.

`NativeMemoryReclamationTests` defaults to real 1 GiB MLX backing in an isolated wired
ticket and checks that cache retirement drops Metal allocation ownership while
preserving an independently live array. Select `DARKBLOOM_NATIVE_RECLAIM_TEST=1`
and the exclusive GPU opt-in; `DARKBLOOM_NATIVE_RECLAIM_MODE=direct` retains the
old unscoped control, while `scoped` compares a test-only autorelease pool.
This native resource test does not replace the full-artifact immediate-reload,
prefill/decode, memory-tier or numerical gates.
Explicit `DARKBLOOM_NATIVE_RECLAIM_GIB=8|64` repeats the same resource/liveness
assertions at larger scale, requiring 24 GiB of OS-available headroom beyond the
declared probe size. Post-release footprint observations are diagnostics, not a
delay added to the model's immediate-reload gate.

`Qwen4ExpLoadFootprintTests` checks complete header/index coverage, retention of
MTP/vision payloads, FP16/unknown-layout fallbacks and the additive native-load
allowance. `NativeMemoryRetirementWindowTests` checks expiry and cancellation;
these do not replace the actual model reload gate. When the loading policy
changes, retain the old requirement/result separately and record the new
checkpoint-derived allowance, full load peak and actual reload outcome.

For the paired SDK MTP/read-profile candidate, run the SDK's
`Qwen4SelectedPageCopiesTests` and `Qwen4ExpMTPPrimingTests`, the original real
Qwen4 state/output-budget oracles, then native OFF/ON and cold/warm-prefix API
qualification. Read copies compare exact bytes against the original ordered
attention path; assistant closeness tests are not a target-losslessness gate.

`TestIntegration_FlashNextConnectedMatrices` in
`e2e/flash_next_connected_matrix_test.go` is an explicit opt-in for the same API
oracles through a real local Go coordinator. Reserve one owned model/GPU lane
first. Supply `DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_CONNECTED_MATRIX=1`, the exact native Next
model ID through `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_MODEL` and `TESTBED_MODEL_ID`, a matching
`DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_MODEL_PATH`, and a verified `DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY` with its
adjacent resources. The pinned checkpoint hash is checked before startup;
similarly named Qwen3.8 27B/M5/NAX fixtures are not substitutes.

Set `DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_MATRIX_MTP` to `off` or `auto`,
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_MATRIX_PYTHON` to the approved Python executable,
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_MATRIX_SCRIPT` to the absolute path of
`scripts/qwen38_validation/connected_matrix_runner.py`, and
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_MATRIX_OUTPUT` to a new private output directory. The
testbed's optional `LocalEndpointPort` uses the native authenticated unified
mode on one locally launched provider. API calls go to the coordinator; metrics
and the original four-field drain checks go to the same provider's loopback
listener. No second model is loaded and neither key is printed or copied from
an operator credential store. Default launches are unchanged.

Retain failures, the one unsupported-high observation, per-suite native metrics
and bounded wire-profile receipts. Synthetic auth, `TrustNone`, skipped
challenges and mock payment services do not qualify production trust or hosted
routing. Audit persistent-key access separately before using a signed runtime.

`TestIntegration_FlashNextExtendedMatrices` is separately opted in with
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_EXTENDED_MATRIX=1`. It keeps the same native/Go setup but
selects the approved runner's `weather`, `fidelity`, `heldout` and `multimodal`
suites. Supply the retained original private fixtures and their verified runner;
do not substitute new prompts, bias special tokens or weaken failed oracles.
These selections report known quality failures and dependency skips separately
from actual request/page retirement and MTP-policy checks. The core 59-cell
matrix remains unchanged.

For single-provider account-cache checks, first run the CPU-only opt-ins in
`e2e/flash_next_cache_manifest_test.go` and
`e2e/flash_next_cache_planner_test.go`. Set
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_CACHE_MANIFEST_CHECK=1`, an absolute
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST`, the selected
`DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_MODEL_PATH`, and a source-verified
`DARKBLOOM_PROMPT_SIDECAR_BINARY`. The manifest contains `model_id`,
`model_type`, `model_aggregate_sha256` and the complete integrity-file `files`
array (`path`, `role`, `size_bytes`, `sha256`), including weights and video
processor metadata. Provisioning checks that full aggregate but downloads only
prompt-role files. The planner check starts only the Rust sidecar, not MLX:

```bash
go test ./e2e -count=1 -run '^TestFlashNextCache(ManifestProvisioning|PlannerBindings)$'
```

After that preflight, an owned maintenance wrapper may select
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_CACHE_SCOPE=1` and run
`TestIntegration_FlashNextCacheScope` in `e2e/flash_next_cache_scope_test.go`,
with the same model/binary/output/MTP bindings described above. It recomputes
the actual loaded model identity, binds the local catalog's weight hash, and
compares two authenticated synthetic accounts with identical caller cache
labels. Retain native drain checks, HTTP equivalence and accepted SSD receipts
for both `off` and `auto`. Sidecar outage and re-preload are separate from
provider-process restart: the ordinary testbed stop helper deletes its temporary
cache directory and cannot establish persistence. These fixtures do not qualify
multi-host routing, signed key durability, raw logits or hosted account trust.

The cache fixture also compares consumer-visible cached/reasoning counts with
the native terminal (`e2e/flash_next_cache_usage_test.go`); observed SSD activity
alone cannot pass this check. `TestStreamingCombinedFinishUsage` in
`coordinator/api/chat_combined_terminal_usage_test.go` covers combined and
separate terminal shapes, absent usage, untrusted cache details, unchanged
totals/content, public identity, signature pairing and a single `[DONE]`.

```bash
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s scripts/qwen38_conversion -p 'test_qwen38_provenance.py' -v
go test ./coordinator/protocol ./coordinator/registry
swift test --package-path provider-swift --filter Qwen4SupportPolicyTests
```

The conversion suite uses synthetic files and a stub quantizer/serializer; it
does not execute MLX or establish numerical conversion parity. Provider source
coverage also includes `Qwen4EmbeddedMTPTests`, `Qwen4FactorySelectionTests`,
`Qwen4ExpMmapFootprintTests`, `Qwen4ReasoningControlTests` and Foundation
`Qwen4MediaPolicyTests`. Run relevant tests without skips after the matching
resources/build are available; a syntax-only SDK pass is not a unit-suite pass.

For actual model qualification, keep PLE enabled and bind every result to one
source/dependency/binary/metallib/artifact tuple:

1. Exercise the real default standalone load guard before weights, qualified
   identity and same-type/name-collision negatives, reservation cleanup, then
   ordinary cold CLI first generation and unload/reload. Exercise the coordinator
   path independently; a preloaded engine or listing is not cold-start evidence.
2. Compare target-only with actual embedded MTP on native paging, prefix cache
   off: target/state/output checks, widths and output boundaries, rejection and
   rollback, PLE first-use/sparse-threshold crossing and exact row gathers.
3. Turn complete prefix caching on separately: cold miss, hot repeat, real suffix,
   SSD-only file-read restore, mixed hit/miss, signed persistent restart,
   tenant/model/template/numerical identity and corrupt/stale-state rejection.
   Confirm native dtypes, ownership and truthful cached-token accounting.
4. Cover disconnect versus legal half-close, cancellation during prefill/decode/
   cache I/O, readmission, model switches, pressure and actual admitted concurrency.
   Check Chat/Responses reasoning/tools/usage/finish behavior and capability-bound
   media acceptance/rejection. Preserve failed cells and distinguish natural stops from full output
   budget tests. Speed targets remain deferred.

## App Attest validation

The [App Attest shadow validation commands](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#validation) cover cryptography, protocol symmetry, counter races, unchanged routing, and coexistence signing. Live macOS 27 acceptance remains separate.

## Prerequisites

- Toolchain from [build.md](build.md) (`mise install`, submodules, `cmake`).
- **Postgres 16** for the coordinator store tests and the e2e suite: either
  Docker (`postgres:16` image is pulled automatically by the testbed) or a
  native `postgres`/`initdb` on `PATH` (`brew install postgresql@16`, then
  `PATH="$(brew --prefix postgresql@16)/bin:$PATH"`). The testbed prefers
  Docker when `docker` is on `PATH` (`e2e/testbed/deps/postgres.go`,
  `PostgresLifecycle.Start`).
- **Hugging Face cache** with the e2e checkpoints:
  `mlx-community/gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4-Q8` (~12.1 GB, default testbed model),
  `mlx-community/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-4bit` (~14.5 GB, second model for
  multi-model suites), and `mlx-community/gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit` (exact-cache
  routing test). CI pins revisions `GPT_OSS_REVISION` /
  `EXACT_CACHE_MODEL_REVISION` in `.github/workflows/integration.yml`.
- `golangci-lint` v2.1.6 for the lint job
  (`go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.1.6`;
  config in `.golangci.yml`).

## Steps

### 1. Run everything CI runs as unit tests

```bash
make test   # coordinator-test prompt-sidecar-test provider-test ui-test benchmark-wrapper-test docs-check
```

### 2. Coordinator (Go)

The Go module lives at the repository root. Run `go test ./coordinator/...`
there to select coordinator packages; keep component `cd` commands in separate
shells when following the repository README examples.

Run prediction telemetry checks from the repository root:

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/api ./coordinator/registry ./coordinator/protocol ./coordinator/store
```

API fixtures use isolated encrypted WebSocket providers;
Postgres tests require an explicitly disposable `DATABASE_URL` and include an
upgrade from the old profile schema. See
[prediction telemetry](../reference/prediction-decision-telemetry.md).

The [admission calibration baseline](../reports/2026-09-06-admission-calibration-baseline.md)
gives the focused `TestTTFTPendingPrompt` comparison command. Its registry
cases exercise preflight, reservation, retained-plan revalidation and retained
output capacity. The HTTP cases cover both a feasible alternative behind a
long pending prompt and a long arrival completing behind a short pending prompt.
They use a real isolated coordinator and encrypted WebSocket providers with
scripted compute. It does not require model downloads or production access.

The CI formatting step checks tracked Go files with `gofmt`. It excludes
`docs/reports/evidence/`, whose captured source bytes are immutable and bound
by evidence manifests. Live Go source remains subject to the formatting gate.

```bash
make coordinator-test                      # cd coordinator && go test ./...
# what CI runs (repo root, race detector, Postgres-backed store tests included):
DATABASE_URL='postgres://testbed:testbed@127.0.0.1:5432/testbed?sslmode=disable' \
  go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic \
    $(go list ./... | grep -vx 'github.com/eigeninference/d-inference/e2e')
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -n 1   # total statement coverage
gofmt -l .                                 # must print nothing
golangci-lint run                          # .golangci.yml
```

CI writes the total statement coverage to the job summary and keeps
`coverage.out` for 14 days as the `coordinator-coverage` artifact. The number
is for information only. A low number does not fail the job.

`TestProfile_RequestProfilesRecorded` checks that the stored transport estimate
matches the difference of coordinator and provider spans. Negative values remain
valid observations; this is not a direct nonnegative network-latency measurement.
The focused `TestApplyProviderProfileTransportEstimateArithmetic` regression covers
positive, negative and missing operands in
`coordinator/api/profiler_provider_test.go`.

Store tests that need Postgres skip themselves when `DATABASE_URL` is unset
(`coordinator/store/harness_test.go`, `testPostgresStore`); CI provides a
`postgres:16` service with user/password/db `testbed`. The pre-push hook runs
`go test $(go list ./... | grep -v /internal/api)` from `coordinator/` to skip
the slow WebSocket integration tests; run the full set before merging.

#### Coordinator startup and reconnect recovery

`TestSupervisorRestartsChildAndBecomesReady` allows a five-second helper startup
and a fifteen-second overall wait so concurrent cold builds do not exhaust its
restart budget. It asserts restart plus readiness, not a production startup SLA;
production supervisor deadlines are unchanged (`coordinator/promptcontract/supervisor_test.go`).

The [startup observer](../operations/coordinator-startup-measurement.md) has
standard-library tests using only local HTTP stubs and a deterministic clock.
They run in Release Integrity CI and make no external inference calls:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/startup_measurement -t scripts -p 'test_*.py'
```


Use a disposable local PostgreSQL database for the startup regressions. Store
tests truncate tables and create/drop isolated databases; never point
`DATABASE_URL` at a shared or production database.

```bash
cd coordinator
# DATABASE_URL must name a throwaway local database.
go test -p 1 ./store ./cmd/coordinator -run 'Test(FreshDatabaseSchema|RecordProviderEarningMaintains|BaseRewardEarningPaths|ProviderEarningsJobIndex|ProviderRestore|PostgresRestore|ProviderAndReputation|Maintenance)' -count=1
go test -race ./api ./registry -run 'Test(ProviderRestore|ProviderPendingRestore|RestoreProviderState|AttachCachedMDAProof|StageDurableMDAChain)' -count=1
```

These check that a fresh database gets the withdrawable balance column and the
usage-totals counter row, live summary maintenance without double-counting a
retried job, base-reward work exclusion, a repeated boot while earnings history
is exclusively locked,
concurrent reconnect exclusion, late initial/reputation-write ordering, atomic
provider/reputation publication and rollback, and newest-prior
identity lookup through CachedStore,
index applicability, MDA trust caps, and a migration-only subprocess that exits
without HTTP startup or admin-key seeding. They do not measure production startup
latency or validate an overlapping coordinator handoff.

Startup recovery regressions also cover catalog-verified index definitions and isolated
planner applicability, transient provider/reputation retries, a shared deadline,
1013 registration teardown before duplicate eviction, and routing/capacity/load
exclusion while a verified identity is restoring. Tests use disposable stores and
localhost WebSockets (`coordinator/api/provider_restore_retry_test.go`,
`coordinator/registry/provider_restore_routing_test.go`); they do not reconnect production providers.

### 3. Prompt-contract sidecar (Rust)

```bash
make prompt-sidecar-format   # cargo fmt --all -- --check
make prompt-sidecar-check    # cargo check --locked --all-targets; cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
make prompt-sidecar-test     # cargo test --locked --all-targets
```

CI additionally builds the static Linux binary through the Dockerfile stage
(`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 --target prompt-sidecar-builder -f coordinator/Dockerfile .`),
checks `file` reports `statically linked|static-pie linked`, and replays the
production prompt vectors against it with
`scripts/verify-prompt-sidecar-linux.sh <binary>`.

CI then measures coverage with `cargo-llvm-cov` 0.9.1 and writes the line
coverage from its `TOTAL` row to the job summary. A low number does not fail
the job. `cargo llvm-cov` runs the sidecar tests a second time, with coverage
instrumentation, so a test failure can first appear in the Report coverage
step. To measure it locally:

```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview --toolchain 1.88.0
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --version 0.9.1 --locked
cd coordinator/promptsidecar && cargo +1.88.0 llvm-cov --locked --all-targets --summary-only
```

A number measured on macOS can differ from the Linux number in CI.


### 4. Provider (Swift) — unit tests with a source-matched metallib

CI also applies the [restored-resource cleanup](build.md#restored-swiftpm-runtime-resources)
before building the debug test product.

`BetaCommandTests` and `IdleCommandTests` drive `setBetaFeature` and
`setIdleUnloadMinutes` with an explicit `configPath` in a unique temporary
directory. That directory is the only mutation and cleanup target; the tests
never create or remove the operator's canonical config. The mixed-mutation
fixture checks both explicit pins and unrelated settings. Run these with
`RuntimeSnapshotConfigTests` when changing
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ConfigMutation.swift` (`withMutableConfig`),
which loads the runtime snapshot, takes the sidecar lock, reloads and saves;
loading a config never migrates or rewrites it.

`WatchdogCommandTests` fails immediately if writing its temporary TOML fails.
Config-only assertions supply an empty environment to `Watchdog.settings`, while
the update opt-out case supplies `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` explicitly.
`LocalEndpointFileTests` checks its temporary-directory environment override and
restores the inherited `DARKBLOOM_LOCAL_DIR` value after each fixture. Run both
suites with `--no-parallel`; suite serialization alone does not isolate other
suites from process-wide environment changes.

`HiddenFileSkippingTest` includes hidden allowlisted weights and configuration,
so removing hidden-entry skipping changes the manifest. `TemplateRenderCheckTests`
uses templates that reject an incorrect BOS value for both tokenizer-config
forms and require the empty default when the config is absent.
`tamperFailsClosed` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCacheTests.swift`
keeps changed metadata valid JSON and requires
`SSDBlockStoreError.authenticationFailed` from the authenticated read; it
separately retains schema-validation rejection.
Run these after building and staging the test product as described below:

```bash
cd provider-swift
swift test --skip-build --no-parallel \
  --filter 'HiddenFileSkippingTest|TemplateRenderCheckTests|tamperFailsClosed'
```

These fixtures use temporary files and an in-memory KEK. They do not exercise
model inference or a hardware-backed encryption key.

For SSD authentication and donation changes, run the filter
`SSDBlockStoreTests|SSDPrefixCacheLifecycleTests|SSDPrefixCacheReadyReceiptTests|SSDPrefixCacheDonationGateTests`
with `--no-parallel`. In `provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCacheTests.swift`,
`tamperFailsClosed` distinguishes valid metadata rejected by DEK authentication
from invalid schemas rejected by header parsing. `responsePathNotDelayed`
requires donation to return while maintenance is held; negative write and ready
checks await `waitForWritesForTesting` before inspecting the result. These use
temporary encrypted files and tiny MLX arrays, not a downloaded model.

The general provider suite passes `--no-parallel` explicitly to Swift Testing.
Unrelated cases share process-wide MLX state and executor capacity; overlapping
thousands of them can starve bounded test handshakes. Concurrency tests retain
their own tasks, barriers and interleavings. This does not serialize provider
inference or the separate model-concurrency benchmarks.

`scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` runs each native allocator assertion, the
controlled ledger interleaving, the real process-environment projection test
and the SSD sidecar stage-deadline test in separate processes. The general
suite excludes those cases; each isolated invocation uses the existing
nonempty/no-skips guard.
A general-suite failure does not silence the isolated gates. Isolation keeps the
stage-deadline assertion at the production budget without unrelated suite load;
it does not change an assertion or runtime resource-selection rule.

`scripts/run-exclusive-native-gpu-test.sh` accepts only the reviewed allocator
and batch-composition test functions. It sets
`DARKBLOOM_EXCLUSIVE_NATIVE_GPU_TEST=1` for that one child process and passes
`--no-parallel`. Ordinary invocations explicitly remove inherited opt-in state.
`scripts/run-paged-kernel-tests.sh` runs the remaining kernel suite and then
the composition assertion separately, preserving both results if either fails.
Run these helpers only on an owned GPU test lane with the matched metallib;
they do not download model weights or manage an inference endpoint.

To check this CI wiring without invoking Swift or using a GPU, run
`python3 scripts/test-native-gpu-ci.py`. Its temporary fake `swift` executable
checks selector/opt-in isolation and verifies that failed assertions, actual
skips and zero executed tests still fail the existing tripwires. The same
CPU-only check runs in the Release Integrity job; it is not GPU qualification.

```bash
make provider-test
# = cd provider-swift && swift build --build-tests
#   ./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh <bin-path>            (build mlx.metallib from libs/mlx-swift source)
#   cp mlx.metallib into every <bin-path>/*PackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/
#   cd provider-swift && swift test --skip-build
```

`PagedKernelPreflightTests.noisyChildCannotDeadlock` runs an owned failing child
with more stderr than a pipe buffer. It checks the bounded result ends with the
child's unique final diagnostic and excludes its initial marker, so keeping the
first bytes cannot pass as a valid tail. The same suite covers child failure,
fast-exit diagnostics, timeout and model-specific native smoke shapes. Run it
with the staged test product described here.

The metallib staging is not optional: MLX loads `mlx.metallib` from beside the
running executable, and for tests the executable is the `.xctest` runner.
Without it kernel-backed tests fail or silently exercise a different kernel
set than production. To run a subset: `cd provider-swift && swift test
--skip-build --filter <Suite>` after `make provider-test` has staged the
metallib once.

For a custom SwiftPM `--scratch-path`, stage the authoritative `mlx.metallib`
in the active `debug` or `release` directory containing the `.xctest` bundle.
`LiveInferenceFixtures.findSourceMetallib` uses that same-configuration source
before replacing the runner copy; a runner-local file alone is insufficient.

Live-fixture result collection must retain both ordinary errors and typed
terminal failures. The loop-path arms in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/EngineV2PagedParityLiveTests.swift`
reuse `collect` and require completion usage as well as output.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/Gemma/GemmaToolCallLiveTests.swift`
uses `LiveInferenceFixtures.swift`'s shared `collect` result before parsing a
tool call. The video mixed-media and standalone response fixtures use throwing
requirements before accessing a required image span or response choice. Run
each enabled live suite in its own supervised process; disabled model gates
provide no inference evidence.

`LiveInferenceFixtures.buildProduct` likewise anchors updater child executables,
fan helpers and resource bundles to the running test bundle's configuration.
Release tests do not require or borrow a separate `.build/debug` tree. Missing
active-configuration products remain failures; no peer-configuration fallback is
used. This is test-fixture discovery, not release signing or deployment evidence.

Tests that change process-wide MLX settings must use Swift Testing's
`#expect(processExitsWith: .success)` child-process boundary. Restoring an
environment variable does not reset MLX's cached value, and `.serialized`
does not isolate other suites. See `StartCommandTests.defaultApplyProjectsSettings`
in `provider-swift/Tests/DarkbloomCLITests/StartCommandTests.swift` and
`GPUEnforcementTests.requireMetalPinsGPU` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Engine/GPUEnforcementTests.swift`.

The standalone resource-release test and the two periodic MTP sampler tests
also use child processes, giving their real listener/timer tasks an executor
separate from concurrent MLX tests. Their original deadlines, recurring-sample
requirements and shutdown/resource assertions remain active. Each helper
requires `ExitTest.current` so it cannot accidentally run in the parent process.
See `standaloneServerStopAndWaitReleaseResidentBridgeAndSSDResources` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Server/StandaloneServerTests.swift` and
`periodicSamplerEmitsForEverySlot` / `shutdownStopsSampler` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Telemetry/MTPPostureTelemetryTests.swift`.

#### Stream and model-list assertions

After building and staging the test product above, run:

```bash
cd provider-swift
swift test --skip-build --no-parallel \
  --filter 'batcherDeliversEveryFrameExactlyOnce|multiModelEngineReturnsSortedIDs|tokenizeFailure'
```

`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Coordinator/ChunkSenderTests.swift`
(`batcherDeliversEveryFrameExactlyOnce`) requires the complete sequence of unique
eight-byte frames after the existing delivery deadline and flush barrier.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Engine/MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngineTests.swift`
(`multiModelEngineReturnsSortedIDs`) checks nonempty registry and advertised
model lists; the advertised input is deliberately out of order.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Engine/EngineV2BridgeTests.swift`
(`tokenizeFailure`) requires an error event before checking its message.
These use the real batcher and adapter with scripted dependencies, not model inference.

**Nested `libs/mlx-swift-lm` suites.** The paged-KV correctness gates live in
the submodule, not in `provider-swift/`. Build them once, stage the metallib,
then run each suite through [`scripts/run-nested-suite.sh`](../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh),
which fails when a suite executes zero tests or skips any (a bare
`swift test --filter` exits 0 on an empty run):

```bash
cd libs/mlx-swift-lm
swift package unedit --force mlx-swift >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
swift package edit --path ../mlx-swift mlx-swift      # use the local mlx-swift, not the remote branch
swift build --build-tests
../../scripts/fetch-metallib.sh "$PWD/.build/debug"            # stage mlx.metallib beside the nested test runner
for b in .build/debug/*PackageTests.xctest; do cp .build/debug/mlx.metallib "$b/Contents/MacOS/"; done
for suite in CBv2PagedSafetyTests CBv2PrefixCacheHasherTests CBv2PagedEligibilityTests \
             CBv2PagedBackendTests CBv2PagedKernelTests CBv2KVSharingParityTests; do
  ../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh "$suite"
done
```

#### Finding provider tests

Start from the production owner, then look in the matching folder under
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/`. These folders remain one SwiftPM
target (`provider-swift/Package.swift`, `package`), so existing suite/function
filters still select the same tests. The [inference source map](../architecture/inference.md#code-map)
locates those owners under `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/`;
tests group engine, bridge, factory and scheduler responsibilities together in
`Inference/Engine`.

| Folder below `ProviderCoreTests` | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Inference/Engine` | Assembly, admission, cancellation, health, device gates and timing |
| `Inference/Memory` | Load budgets, KV grants, allocation ownership and memory telemetry |
| `Inference/PrefixCache` | Reuse eligibility, cache identity, receipts and routing evidence |
| `KVCacheSSD` | Encrypted SSD storage, checkpoint coordination and persistence |
| `Inference/MTP` | Assistant activation and inference capacity accounting |
| `Inference/Prompting`, `Inference/Tools`, `Inference/Streaming`, `Inference/Vision` | Request preparation, tool contracts, streamed output and media handling |
| `Inference/Kernels` | Synthetic Metal arithmetic and accuracy contracts |
| `Inference/Live` | Opt-in inference and parity tests using actual local models, with `Gemma`, `GPTOSS` and `Qwen` subfolders |

Other folders follow provider responsibilities: `ProviderLoop`, `Server`,
`Models`, `SpecDec`, `Auth`, `Security`, `Diagnostics`, `Protocol`, `Coordinator`,
`Telemetry`, `Update`, and the smaller source subsystems. `Benchmark` tests
the `ProviderBenchmark` module and its production-engine integration.
Drain/swap orchestration stays with `ProviderLoop` and `Server`.

Keep model fixtures in `Inference/Live/Fixtures`, synthetic engine support in
`Inference/Fixtures`, checkpoint support in `KVCacheSSD/Fixtures`, and shared
HTTP/coordinator fixtures in `Helpers`. Shared input files under `fixtures/`
and `coordinator/protocol/testdata/` remain canonical; moving a test deeper
requires checking any lookup based on `#filePath`.
`CachePromptParityTests.vectorFile` locates the owning repository using its
provider and coordinator manifests instead of assuming a fixed source-folder
depth. Its three suites still read the canonical shared vectors; a missing
fixture fails the test and is never replaced by a skip or copied test data.

Check each suite's annotations and prerequisites before running it. Tests
that need no model weights can still execute Metal. The startup decode live
test stays with its `ProviderLoop` owner, and `LiveInferenceMetallibSourceTests`
tests the fixture resolver without loading a model. Use the preparation and
isolated filters above; folder names do not change execution requirements.

#### Doctor capture and attestation canonical bytes

After building the provider test targets, run these focused regressions:

```bash
(cd provider-swift && swift test --filter 'DoctorCaptureTests|statusCanonical')
(cd coordinator && go test -race ./attestation -count=1)
```

`provider-swift/Tests/DarkbloomCLITests/DoctorCaptureTests.swift`
(`DoctorCaptureTests`) uses real subprocesses with output beyond pipe capacity,
excluded stderr, nonzero exits, deadline escalation and an inherited stdout
descriptor. Each child has an independent expiry and fixture-owned cleanup.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Security/StatusCanonicalTests.swift`
(`statusCanonicalMatchesCoordinatorNestedMapVectors`) and
`coordinator/attestation/status_canonical_mixed_case_test.go`
(`TestBuildStatusCanonicalNestedMapVectors`) retain identical
golden bytes for nested-map ordering, escaping and optional fields. These cases
need no model weights, active provider or Secure Enclave key.

#### Strict FP32 unit controls

Run the strict tiny-model projection and scheduled-prefill comparisons in fresh
processes with TF32 disabled, matching MLX's own unit-test runner:

```bash
cd libs/mlx-swift-lm
for suite in GPTOSSPrefillOutputTests CBv2Gemma4ScheduledPrefillTests; do
  MLX_ENABLE_TF32=0 ../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh "$suite" -c release --no-parallel
done
```

Build and stage the optimized test product and its matching metallib first.
`libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/python/tests/run.py` disables TF32 for regular
FP32 test precision. `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/utils.h`
(`env::enable_tf32`) otherwise defaults it on and caches the value per process;
Metal matmul and attention consult that gate. On M5, the default TF32 paths can
change these strict unit comparisons without a cache implementation change.
Keep the original assertions and tolerances. This command qualifies only the
selected controls, not the full test suite. Leave `MLX_ENABLE_TF32` unset for
production-default live cache tests and model benchmarks; record any explicit
numerical override as a separate experiment.

#### Ordinary teacher-forced score diagnostics

Build and stage the source-matched metallib for both test products as above.
From the repository root, run the numerical/engine controls and the provider
input/CLI controls; the shared runner rejects empty or skipped suites:

```bash
(
  cd libs/mlx-swift-lm
  for suite in CBv2TeacherForcedScoreDiagnosticTests CBv2TeacherForcedScoringTests \
               CBv2TeacherForcedRecurrentTests CBv2TeacherForcedCapacityTests \
               CBv2PagedRuntimeDTypeEngineTests \
               CBv2TopTwoTests CBv2LogitDiagnosticTests CBv2GemmaLogitDiagnosticTests; do
    ../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh "$suite"
  done
)
(
  cd provider-swift
  for suite in TeacherForcedBenchmarkTests BenchmarkTeacherForcedOptionsTests \
               BenchmarkSchedulerPrefillDecisionTests PrefixCacheCheckpointIdentityTests; do
    ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh "$suite"
  done
)
```

For an actual model observation, retain exact prompt and continuation token IDs
and the verified model aggregate hash in the [input JSON schema](../provider/cli-reference.md#teacher-forced-scores).
Set `MODEL_ID`, `INPUT_JSON` and `REPORT_JSON` to the matching local model and
absolute input/output paths, then run:

```bash
darkbloom benchmark --model "$MODEL_ID" --kv-backend contiguous \
  --teacher-forced-input "$INPUT_JSON" > "$REPORT_JSON"
```

Use `paged` to observe that backend explicitly. Inspect `status`,
`inconclusiveReasons`, `plainTop1`, `activity`, `diagnostic` and
`repeatedDiagnostic`; retain the JSON even on exit 2. `observed` means the
instrumentation controls passed, not that model quality or speculative
verification passed. The controls compare ordinary forwards only
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/TeacherForcedBenchmark.swift`,
`controlReasons`).

Recurrent targets use fresh request-owned state for each scoring call. The
scorer reserves the normal admission peak before forwarding, commits evaluated
state after each chunk or forced token, and retires state and KV before refunding
the reservation. The [recurrent scoring validation](../reports/2026-09-06-recurrent-teacher-scoring.md)
covers tight capacity and open-binding failure recovery on both backends.

#### Quantized bias accumulation regression

`QuantizedBiasAccumulatorTests` covers 216 exact affine-bias cases across
BF16, FP16 and FP32 inputs, quantization widths 2/3/4/5/6/8, aligned and tail
dimensions, and one/two input rows. Zero packed weights and unit bias isolate
input accumulation from weight quantization. Run it after the
[embedded shader rebuild](build.md#swift-provider-macos):

```bash
cd provider-swift
../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh QuantizedBiasAccumulatorTests
```

The provider test target links the canonical test from `libs/mlx-swift`.
The test scopes GPU selection with public `MLX.Device.withDefaultDevice`, so
both targets compile the same test without depending on target-local helpers.
Passing these operator cases does not replace full-model trajectory, cache,
batching or performance validation.

#### Explicit Gemma verifier and projection controls

Use the candidate `radix-engine` built from the same provider, native source and
metallib tuple as the test runners.
Candidate inputs use `EngineV2Factory.benchmarkPrompt` and the serving sampling
translator, including the raw-body seed, logit-bias and logprobs overlays.
Every completed or cancelled row reports its effective `sampling`; batched copies
preserve those knobs. Omitted sampling stays greedy. The production API currently
sets `min_p` to zero, including when an unrecognized `min_p` request key is present.
Native direct `Input` fixtures can still exercise engine `minP` independently.

Use `--generation-comparison-policy record` for sampled throughput probes: a seed also
depends on request ID and step index, so separate donor/recovery requests are not
an exact-token oracle. Do not change the strict default for greedy controls.
Nonempty stop strings and `response_format` require HTTP testing and are rejected.
Forced tool choices are rejected for sampled inputs; retained greedy tool-template
probes measure rendering and raw engine events, without HTTP constraint enforcement.
Explicit Gemma verification, projection, logits and attention diagnostics require
untransformed greedy input. Historical baseline binaries retain their greedy
sampling path; they are not sampled-throughput controls.
Sampling wiring lives in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+BenchmarkPrompt.swift`
and `scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Sources/radix-engine/BenchmarkSampling.swift`.

Run the CPU wrapper tests first:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks -p test_run_radix_engine.py
```

After building each package's tests and staging that tuple's metallib as above,
run these filters through `scripts/run-nested-suite.sh` from the listed package:

| Package | Filters |
|---|---|
| `provider-swift` | `EngineV2BenchmarkMTPVerificationTests`, `BenchmarkProductionInputTests` |
| `libs/mlx-swift-lm` | `Gemma4Layer0ProjectionDiagnosticTests` |
| `scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine` | `BenchmarkGemmaVerifierOptionsTests`, `BenchmarkGemmaProjectionTests`, `BenchmarkSamplingTests` |

For the radix package, set `RADIX_SOURCE_ROOT` to the absolute combined checkout
and `RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=1` for both build and test commands. The tests cover
scope refusals, unchanged MTP configuration fields, actual tiny-engine rounds
and retirement, native projection shapes/parameter identity, and full-output
difference counts. They do not validate a downloaded model.

For a real-model control, append `--gemma-mtp-verification automatic` or
`--gemma-mtp-verification serial_target` to `scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_engine.py`.
Both require `--mtp on --cache off --concurrency 1 --cache-mode ssd
--production-kv-grant`, a pinned `--expected-model-sha256`, an explicit
`--kv-backend contiguous|paged`, and a compatible loaded Gemma assistant.
Omitting the flag leaves normal verifier selection unchanged. Run fresh
ordinary MTP-off, automatic and serial processes for each backend using the
same reviewed artifact, input bytes, assistant, prompt date and output limit.
Keep all seven completed trajectories and cancellation recovery evidence.

Inspect `gemma_mtp_verification_requested` together with the actual `mtp`
metrics: the selected strategy must have positive rounds and the other strategy
must have zero rounds. Compare complete prompt/output IDs and finish reasons
separately for each pair. Serial agreement cannot pass the automatic gate.

To inspect layer zero, add `--gemma-projection-tokens SEED,SECOND_TOKEN` to one
explicit-verifier invocation, without other numerical diagnostic flags. Preserve
the record or stated inference that selected the second token. The adjacent
`.gemma-projection/projection.json` and native `.bin` files retain actual
embedding, inputLayernorm and Q/K/V outputs for M1/M2, tensor dtypes/strides,
loaded parameter hashes and complete first-column differences. Check embedding
and normalized-input identity before attributing a projection difference.
Internal kernel identity is unmeasured; this process's timing is diagnostic
overhead. Neither capture nor a passing tiny-model test establishes model-token
correctness. Controls: `EngineV2BenchmarkMTPVerification.validateScope` and
`validateObservedMetrics`; export: `BenchmarkGemmaProjection.capture` in
`scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Sources/radix-engine/BenchmarkGemmaProjection.swift`.

#### Offline attention packet analysis

Create the [isolated NumPy environment](build.md#offline-attention-analysis-environment),
then run from the repository root:

```bash
/tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv/bin/python -B -W error -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks -p 'test_attention_packet*.py'
PYTHONPATH=scripts/benchmarks /tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv/bin/python -B -m attention_packet /absolute/packet.json --output /absolute/new-analysis.json
```

The output path must be new. Review the reported status, original-query reference,
nonfinite counts and last-row consistency. `analyzed` means the calculation ran;
it does not establish model correctness or pass a release gate. Unsupported or
unconfirmed captures remain inconclusive. The [packet format](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention_packet/FORMAT.md)
defines required native bytes and metadata; [synthetic calibration](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-packet-analyzer.md)
records what the tests prove.

#### Attention operator replay

The [standalone tool](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention-replay/README.md) validates
a confirmed packet v1, then runs native SDPA and fixed/segmented paged decode
sequentially on identical Q/K/V bytes. From `scripts/benchmarks`, use the dedicated
NumPy environment:

```bash
python -B -m unittest -v test_attention_replay test_attention_packet test_attention_packet_numerics
python -B -m attention_replay --packet /owned/capture/packet.json \
  --output /owned/new-replay --prepare-only
python -B -m attention_replay --packet /owned/capture/packet.json \
  --output /owned/another-new-replay --binary /reviewed/attention-replay \
  --binary-sha256 EXACT_SHA256
```

Use a new output directory each time. The Swift CLI checks the input-transfer
hash and raw tensor hashes before MLX allocation. For captured-output reproduction,
use the capture host and reviewed runtime resources; a different device is a
separately labeled numerical experiment.

The native SPI seeds only T−1 tokens with the existing writer, then performs the
real incoming-token write through `updateAndAttend`. Full readback bytes are
checked after evaluation. Paged dispatch is observed through the existing hook;
the synthetic selection is never marked as a confirmed model sample. Native SDPA
identifies the API invoked, not an instrumented internal MLX kernel variant.

`ReplayHostTests` covers bounded transfer/IO/options. `ReplayOperatorTests` executes
24 synthetic operator cases plus one host guard, with all three genuine arms in
each operator case. The existing native reference ceiling `1e-2` and paged bound
`max(3 * contiguous relativeL2, 1e-2)` remain unchanged. Exact storage bytes and
fixed/segmented output identity are separate checks. The [milestone](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-operator-replay.md)
retains exact source and test provenance.

Original Q drives the independent CPU FP32 reference; a narrowed-Q counterfactual
is separate. Storage mismatch, nonfinite output or failure to reproduce the
originally captured backend output makes interpretation inconclusive. Failed arms
stop and retain their process receipt even if log hashing fails. No model-token
or numerical release gate is evaluated. Supplied-history placement does not prove
original model-history correctness; the full-history mirror and cross-backend
Q/K/V identity remain separate investigations.

#### Segmented metadata profiler

Use the [isolated optimized build](build.md#segmented-metadata-profiler) on an idle
Apple Silicon host, with matching runtime resources beside the binary:

```bash
/absolute/path/to/BenchSegmentedDecode --owners 10 --offset 5584 --warmup 8 --steps 64 --repetitions 3 > /absolute/new-measurement.json
```

The tool compares cached and freshly rebuilt metadata on identical synthetic
inputs and refuses differing output or full-history hashes. Inspect per-owner
hit/rebuild counts, resolved geometry and separate host/fenced timings. These
measure attention work; use the real-model benchmark for end-to-end performance.
The [measurement record](../reports/2026-09-06-segment-metadata-profiler.md) retains
the source, boundary tests and observed timing scope.

#### Prefix-cache benchmark validation

The standalone scripts under [`scripts/benchmarks`](../../scripts/benchmarks/radix_prefix_cache.py)
retain complete requests, SSE events, token counts, cache evidence, and GPU
telemetry. Use a dedicated idle Mac with the model already downloaded. The
runner refuses concurrent ranked work and owns only its child processes.

```bash
# Use the attention-analysis environment below for the NumPy-dependent tests.
/tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks -p 'test_*.py'
python3 scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_http.py --binary /path/to/baseline/darkbloom \
  --output /path/to/new-baseline-run --mtp off --cache on
python3 scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_http.py --binary /path/to/candidate/darkbloom \
  --output /path/to/new-candidate-run --mtp off --cache on \
  --replay /path/to/new-baseline-run/http/report.json
python3 scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_engine.py --binary /path/to/radix-engine \
  --model-directory /path/to/pinned-model-snapshot \
  --input /path/to/new-baseline-run/http/report.json \
  --output /path/to/new-engine-run --cache on
python3 scripts/benchmarks/compare_radix_engine.py baseline-engine.json candidate-engine.json \
  --expect-cache-hits
```

Build each engine probe using the [pinned-worktree instructions](build.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-executable).
HTTP equality proves full text and token counts; the engine comparison checks
actual generated token IDs, clean termination, saved tokens, tenant separation,
and cancellation recovery. Compare MTP-on and MTP-off against their respective
baselines. A cache lookup with zero saved tokens does not demonstrate reuse.
The connected SSE reader treats `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` as aliases
for one delta: it appends one value and rejects conflicting non-null values.
Different chunk boundaries must not change reconstructed reasoning. The captured
real-stream replay runs under `go test ./e2e -run '^TestConnectedReasoning'`
(`e2e/connected_cache_reasoning_test.go`).
For schema-2 reports, the default cache axis requires cache off then cache on,
with the same requested store/key modes and resolved backend. Every disabled
probe must report zero saved tokens and no hit. Use `--axis backend` for a
contiguous-to-paged pair with identical cache settings. Legacy report support
does not establish the current release gates (`compare_radix_engine.py`, `compare`).
Both runners accept `--mtp on` and `--kv-backend paged`; their defaults are MTP
off and backend auto. The current direct candidate defaults to `--cache-mode ssd`.
For a separately reviewed generation-variation experiment, pass
`--generation-comparison-policy record` to `run_radix_engine.py` and a probe
built with that option. The default is `strict`. Record mode retains raw token
arrays and every same-prompt comparison, including row identities, token hashes,
equality outcomes and first differing positions. It continues past generated-token
differences while structural, authenticated restore, tenant isolation, cancellation
and cleanup checks remain required. A record-mode report never has
`strict_generation_pass: true`; review task quality separately. The standard
`compare_radix_engine.py` stays strict and rejects record-mode reports. A reviewed
diagnostic consumer must explicitly request `report_errors(report, "record")`
from `scripts/benchmarks/radix_engine_evidence.py` and retain the comparison
failures. Preserve prior strict failures as separate evidence.
The direct candidate uses the normal slot factory, production prompt/tool normalization, normal
MTP preparation and verified pre/post-load model identity. For an external
assistant, `--assistant-directory` supplies an exact flat artifact to the normal
offline verification funnel; it does not bypass target compatibility.
The directory must contain only `config.json` and its safetensors files; keep
the catalog/provenance manifest outside it. `SpecDecStore.inspectLocalArtifact`
rejects other entries, including `manifest.json`.
`--expected-model-sha256` pins the aggregate and `--prompt-date YYYY-MM-DD`
pins missing request-owned dates for paired runs. Raw media needs the HTTP path. It refuses requested MTP without an active driver,
a cache-on arm without a ready SSD store, and any resident-memory opt-in.
Start TTFT before `session.submit` so authenticated staging is included
(`EngineV2Factory+BenchmarkSession.swift`, `BenchmarkLoader.swift`).

For bounded concurrency, add `--concurrency 2` or `--concurrency 4` to the
engine runner. Each input is submitted as that many simultaneous requests;
reports retain every row, submission failure, batch duration, aggregate output
rate, and capacity/MLX-memory samples at 100 ms intervals. Compare with a cold
oracle from the same binary, concurrency, slot grant, model and MTP mode.
Choose the grant mode explicitly for the measurement. Use
`--production-kv-grant` for a single loaded model's full production grant, or
`--kv-budget-gib N` for an explicit envelope control. With neither flag the
historical explicit default remains 16 GiB. B1/B2/B4 changes request concurrency,
not the number of loaded model slots. Record the observed backend and capacity,
and reject a requested paged arm that falls back. The comparator rejects missing/failed batch rows and unobserved
concurrency in either arm. B4 identifies four submitted requests; the sampled
overlap check does not certify four simultaneously admitted sequences or a
continuous memory peak. It checks staged-memory release after the whole batch drains;
another active request may still own staging when an individual row ends.
These raw-engine batches exercise shared native admission for segmented storage;
they do not cover bridge dispatch, contiguous bridge reservations or HTTP framing.

Candidate builds with `RADIX_CANDIDATE` emit report schema 3 and bounded
`forward_shapes` telemetry. After warmup, the benchmark opens a fresh observation
scope and records before/after snapshots around each measured cohort. A new
scope requires the scheduler and in-flight work to drain, including discarded
chained successors whose output request has already stopped. B2/B4
acceptance requires a completed target decode or MTP-verification call with the
requested live row count in every cohort. Four B1 calls, speculative columns,
prefill rows and padded compiled components cannot satisfy that gate.

`submitted_calls` counts entry into model dispatch, including lazy graph
construction; it is not a GPU submission count. `completed_calls` records the
existing readback and MTP-finalization boundary. Counter retirement follows the
adaptive MTP cost sample. Snapshot/delta inconsistencies, pending or unconfirmed
work, unknown dispatches and dropped records reject the measured interval.
Component rows and sequence width remain separate axes. An observed full-width
call proves neither constant width for the whole request nor kernel launch
geometry; the existing concurrency, lifecycle and output gates still apply.
The native `CBv2ForwardShapeEngineTests` exercise packed/split target dispatch,
discarded chained work and refusal boundaries with storage-bearing cache rows
and actual KV progression. Run these alongside the scalar, compiled-expert and
MTP suites; scalar-only checks cannot establish serving behavior.
When the native engine exposes `paged_storage`, before/after metrics and batch
samples retain its queue-captured grant, committed backing, reserved/live pages,
poison, slack, and over-grant bytes, plus segment and address-page counts.
Committed bytes measure physical backing; they are not the logical token limit.

For a production-grant run, add the flag to the existing candidate invocation:

```bash
python3 scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_engine.py --binary /path/to/final/radix-engine \
  --model-directory /path/to/exact-model \
  --input /path/to/pinned-http-report.json --output /path/to/new-run \
  --cache-mode ssd --key-mode persistent --cache on --kv-backend paged \
  --mtp on --concurrency 4 --production-kv-grant \
  --expected-model-sha256 "$MODEL_SHA256" --prompt-date 2026-09-05 --trial 1
```

Set `MODEL_SHA256` to the verified target aggregate. Keep the model's configured
MTP posture: use `--mtp off` for GPT-OSS; supply the verified
`--assistant-directory` for Gemma's normal assistant. Repeat with cache off,
contiguous storage and the other concurrency/trial values required by the plan,
using the same artifact and prompt date. The flag does not promote a different
artifact or silently disable MTP.

Verify `kv_grant_mode = "production_single_slot"` and the recorded
`production_grant`: hard/effective cap, operator reserve, cap fraction, loaded
target/assistant/total weights, activation reserve, zero RAM prefix allowance,
`slot_count = 1`, fleet budget and resulting grant. Require the actual engine
ceiling and shared process cap/reserve to agree with those inputs. The separate
`post_build_headroom_bytes` must pass the normal minimum serviceability gate;
a larger logical grant cannot waive insufficient live OS/activation headroom.
`post_load_maximum_kv_bytes` is the retained Memory.active diagnostic and an
explicit-mode guard only. Production mode uses loaded `SlotSizingSnapshot`
facts, not that allocator observation. See the
[grant mechanism](../architecture/hardware-support.md#kv-slot-grants).

Production mode is unavailable to resident reproduction, native-type-only probes
and callers injecting a multi-session budget. Co-resident tests must use the
real provider lifecycle or explicit grants with one shared process authority.
The comparator requires paired production-grant inputs to match and rejects
missing or inconsistent grant/headroom evidence (`radix_engine_evidence.py`,
`production_grant_errors`; `compare_radix_engine.py`, `compare`).

The candidate's `--native-kv-probe-only` mode requires cache-off, MTP-off and
concurrency one. Preserve its actual prefill/decode K/V observations before
selecting a paged native-type table. This target-only diagnostic does not prove
paged serving, MTP execution or prefix reuse; those require the normal benchmark
arms and their output oracle.

Record actual cache mode, key mode, stage time, saved tokens and idle reservation
counters. The session waits for pending refunds after a serial terminal. The
candidate harness then polls immutable snapshots at known serial, whole-batch
and shutdown boundaries until retirement is observable, with a five-second
monotonic deadline and cooperative yields. It does not advance engine steps or
change native gauges. Concurrent rows retain immediate observations; only their
completed batch has an idle boundary. Its
normal construction, shared native ownership and SSD staging are real; the
raw-engine measurement omits bridge dispatch, contiguous bridge reservations,
HTTP framing and coordinator routing.
Schema-2 SSD acceptance requires zero request activity, live KV and reserved/live
pages after serial rows and complete batches. The idle admission charge may
equal retained free physical backing. Shutdown additionally requires zero
segments, committed backing and process owners/closing owners/C/M/unmaterialized
promises. Logical `address_pages`, model-weight memory, allocator cache and RSS
need not be zero (`radix_engine_evidence.py`, `retirement_errors`).
Inspect `idle_observation`: `status` (`ready`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`),
`shutdown`, `attempts`, `elapsed_s`, `timeout_s`, and `pending_retirement`.
Timeout or cancellation preserves the last observed tuple and fails the result;
later successful cleanup does not replace an earlier failure. The deadline
bounds repeated polling, not an arbitrarily blocked snapshot implementation.
Request TTFT, decode, terminal-tail and batch elapsed timers stop before this
observation wait (`BenchmarkIdleObservation.swift`, `capture`). Archived reports
without coherent observations retain their original idle failures; terminal
delivery alone does not prove that gauges have published or that memory leaked.
Local provider HTTP measurements cover bridge admission and framing. Coordinator
routing has separate Go regression coverage; an end-to-end routing claim requires
a live multi-provider run. Record source and artifact hashes with every result;
[the cache architecture](../architecture/prefix-cache.md) links retained validation
evidence.

The connected routing fixture preserves the testbed's provider startup and process
logs, including provider-index attributes, alongside its structured routing
observations. A registration failure can occur before any routing decision;
inspect the captured test output as well as the report's routing rows
(`e2e/connected_cache_report_test.go`, `connectedRouteHandler`).

Schema 2 writes an atomic initial report before loading, then preserves every
completed, failed, aborted or not-run cell. Raw token IDs, chunks, usage and
errors survive a failure; later cells stop. Use distinct invocations with
`--trial 1`, `--trial 2`, and `--trial 3` for independent process repetitions.
Each invocation uses a fresh payload root unless `--cache-directory` explicitly
selects one for a restart test. Retain binary/model/input hashes, request date,
assistant identity, actual backend, key mode, slot grant and concurrency.

The comparator defaults to `--axis cache`, which requires the same backend.
Use `--axis backend` for contiguous versus paged with cache enabled state and
other settings held fixed. Missing, failed, unmatched or unexercised required
cells fail comparison; a clean fast completion is not cancellation evidence.
The current direct harness records `cancellation_probe_version = 2`. It first
completes a donor in the exact cancellation scope in both compared arms. For
paged SSD cache-on, cancellation must then show a real hit, staged import,
positive matched/saved tokens and a fresh authenticated read-byte increase.
The cancelled output must match a prefix of the donor output, and recovery
must reproduce the full donor output. Keep an eligible long-prompt control;
a short prompt below cache policy thresholds cannot establish this restore
case. The completed donor remains reusable after cancellation. Version 1
reports establish cold cancellation only and cannot be compared as version 2
(`RadixBenchmark.swift`, `BenchmarkGeneration.swift`,
`radix_engine_evidence.py`, `cancellation_errors`).

Decode rate excludes every token in the first nonempty delta and divides the
remaining tokens by elapsed time between the first and last deltas. This avoids
counting a first MTP chunk as later decode work; reports retain both raw counts.
Batch samples also retain process commitments, materialized backing, other
allocator use, retirement debt, allocator padding and write-host ownership.
Sampling observations are not a continuous peak guarantee.

Keep evidence scopes separate. `SegmentedProductionGrantTests` exercises native
page/ring/dtype and normal Qwen MTP accounting in synthetic 36/64/128 GiB
memory envelopes; zero-page construction and pure accounting are not measured
model capacity. `BenchmarkProductionGrantTests` checks policy composition and
the separate live minimum gate. A source freeze documents unrun code; a compiled
test result proves only its exercised fixtures. Neither replaces exact-model
B1/B2/B4 serving, real admission boundaries, latency/memory observations or
co-resident load/unload runs. The 0.9.0 candidate's `auto` policy prefers paged
for the [five exact release artifacts](../architecture/prefix-cache.md), subject
to capability checks and fallback. Verify the actual backend in each run;
the source default alone does not establish release acceptance.

The Python runner binds all three isolated-cache controls together: it sets
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL=1`, the owned
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_TEST_ROOT`, and
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_TEST_PERSISTENT_KEY=1` for persistent/default mode or
`0` for explicit ephemeral mode. These values override inherited test settings.
The root override is ignored without the affirmative isolation opt-in.

`--cache-mode ssd --key-mode persistent` is the SSD default and requires the
normal persistent KEK unless an explicit test namespace is selected;
`--key-mode ephemeral` is a non-restart test control.
Current SSD reports must prove the requested actual `metrics_loaded.key_mode`;
a missing or different mode fails the wrapper after preserving the report.
When invoking the executable directly, set the same environment controls as
well as the final `persistent-key` or `ephemeral-key` argument. That argument
controls acceptance and does not by itself select the key. Cache construction
refusal retains the exact pre-shutdown model status and evidence-source presence
in `EngineV2BenchmarkSession.Failure.ssdUnavailable`.

Assert persistent key mode, expected SSD mode and no resident bank for a restart
claim. Launch a fresh OS
process using the same binary/model,
identity settings, keys and payload root; an in-process `shutdown` is not a
restart or model-unload proof because the session/`Loaded` value can still own
`rawEngine`. Key bytes remain in the selected Secure Enclave/Keychain hierarchy,
never the payload root. Exact controls are in [the SSD reference](../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#environment-variables).

<a id="isolated-persistent-test-namespace"></a>

For a standalone persistent test that keeps the default key selectors untouched,
provide both `--persistent-test-namespace UUID` and
`--persistent-test-access-group GROUP` alongside explicit `--cache-mode ssd
--key-mode persistent`. Use a fresh owned `--cache-directory` outside protected
cache roots and the concrete access group authorized for the signed benchmark.
For a later restart comparison, retain the same UUID, group, payload root,
binary/model/input identities and launch a new process into a new output directory.

The wrapper sets the three isolation environment controls above and forwards the
paired options unchanged except canonical UUID casing. Direct executable callers
must set the same context themselves. Partial/duplicate options, resident or
ephemeral mode, probe-only mode and unsafe roots refuse before model or key work.
The shared key loader repeats validation and forbids ephemeral fallback for a
namespace even when the isolation opt-in is enabled. Reports bind namespace,
enclave/wrapped-KEK selectors, root, group and observed key mode; cache-off rows can
truthfully report no created key. No key bytes are exported.

CPU wrapper coverage is `test_radix_persistent_test_keys.py`. Candidate Swift
coverage is `SSDPersistentTestKeyNamespaceTests` and
`BenchmarkPersistentTestKeysTests`; the former injects persistent-loader spies,
while the latter also verifies combination with packet/metadata/logit options.
Keep real Secure Enclave/Keychain tests separate from these source fixtures.
The [validated milestone](../reports/2026-09-06-persistent-ssd-test-namespace.md)
records 23 provider and 24 benchmark functions, with exact old/current source
provenance and preserved failures. This seam does not isolate full HTTP provider
attestation and is not evidence of an actual persistent restart.

Use `--cache-mode resident` only to reproduce earlier candidate artifacts.
That arm supplies a 1 GiB, 32-entry bank with two checkpoints per request, or
paged resident blocks on the explicit paged backend. Inspect `capacity_refusals`,
`retained_bytes`, `kv_compactions` and `kv_compaction_bytes` for long prompts.
Paged cancellation may leave finalized prefill blocks reusable; complete SSD
and hybrid-bank publication require natural donor termination. All arms require
exact recovery output. The comparator rejects observed cache-budget violations;
a latency-only plan reports no decode rate.
The historical [M5 baseline report](../reports/2026-09-05-radix-prefix-cache-baseline.md)
retains exact artifacts and measurement limits.
Use the [Gemma QAT4bit observation and paired-run evidence](../reports/2026-09-05-gemma-qat4-initial-pairs.md)
for that exact production artifact; keep it distinct from the earlier 8-bit Gemma
fixture. Native observer shapes describe incoming writes, not accumulated cache length.
The [initial supported backend groups](../reports/2026-09-05-supported-backend-groups.md)
retain passing GPT/Gemma8 comparisons, failing Qwen3.5 backend comparisons and
explicitly unrun historical contiguous-SSD cells. A passing cache pair alone
does not establish attention-backend parity.

To inspect a differing target decision, append both
`--logit-diagnostic-position <zero-based-output-index>` and
`--logit-diagnostic-candidates <id1,id2>` to the unchanged engine-wrapper command.
This requires B1 and explicit `--cache-mode ssd`; preserve the original backend,
MTP, cache-on/off setting, prompt and output budget. Capture observes the first
main request after warmup. Compare its emitted IDs and preceding context with
the corresponding uninstrumented control before interpreting the compact
`logit_diagnostic` records. Rejected speculative suffixes do not prove emitted
history, and missing confirmed records are inconclusive. Additional reductions
can perturb adaptive scheduling; do not use diagnostic runs as performance data.
Diagnostic top-two reduction is model-independent. It reuses a retained MTP
policy reduction when available and otherwise uses the common reducer; enabling
the diagnostic does not grant a model MTP policy eligibility. The
[generic reducer validation](../reports/2026-09-06-generic-logit-diagnostic-reducer.md)
covers the actual Gemma adapter. The [real-model QAT logit rerun](../reports/2026-09-06-gemma-qat-actual-logits.md)
passes four integrity cells and captures confirmed normal-MTP decisions while
retaining the strict backend token failure.
The [diagnostic source and validation record](../reports/2026-09-05-bounded-logit-diagnostic.md)
describes the bounded payload and unmeasured quantities.
The [Qwen3.6 actual-logit record](../reports/2026-09-05-qwen36-actual-logits.md)
retains same-build trace controls and the unresolved backend decision difference.
The [Gemma QAT MTP-off backend controls](../reports/2026-09-06-gemma-qat-mtp-off-controls.md)
pass exact comparison across all seven completed trajectories; the normal-MTP
failure remains a separate acceptance gate.


To observe actual attention input/cache dtypes, append
`--attention-metadata-position <zero-based-output-index>` to an ordinary B1,
MTP-off command with explicit `--cache-mode ssd`. Preserve cache-on/off, backend,
prompt and output budget. Index zero is unsupported because it is a prefill
decision. This flag can accompany the logit flags for the same position. Require
`attention_metadata.status=captured`, complete owner records and confirmed
seed/target identity before interpreting the result. Strides describe graph
construction; no tensor contents are captured. Use identical uninstrumented
controls and keep diagnostic timings out of performance summaries. The
[attention metadata validation record](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-metadata-diagnostic.md)
describes the bounds and lifecycle checks.

To capture native tensor bytes for one full-attention owner, append both
`--attention-packet-position <zero-based-output-index>` and
`--attention-packet-layer <dense-storage-index>` to the same ordinary B1,
MTP-off wrapper command with explicit `--cache-mode ssd`. Preserve backend,
cache-on/off, prompt and output budget. Position zero is unsupported. The dense
storage index is distinct from the original model layer index; verify both in
the captured owner metadata. Packet, metadata and logit selections are independent.

Require a captured, confirmed packet and unchanged completed trajectories against
a control from the same build before interpreting its bytes. The benchmark writes
the descriptor and six hashed native buffers beneath `report.attention-packet`;
use the [packet format](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention_packet/FORMAT.md) and
[offline analysis procedure](#offline-attention-packet-analysis). Unsupported
geometry, incomplete history, a pending graph or an exceeded capture budget makes
the diagnostic inconclusive. Diagnostic timings are excluded from performance
comparisons. The [capture validation record](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-packet-capture.md)
documents native lifetime, byte-integrity and benchmark export coverage.

The [Qwen3.6 owner-0 packet record](../reports/2026-09-06-qwen36-owner0-packets.md)
retains four passing control/capture integrity cells, identical captured Q/K/V,
786 differing BF16 output elements and descriptive CPU reference comparisons.
The [same-input operator replay](../reports/2026-09-06-qwen36-owner0-operator-replay.md)
reproduces each captured output on its corresponding real operator, with exact
full KV readbacks in fixed and segmented paged pools. The strict whole-model
token comparison remains failed; this selected operator result is separate
from model-quality acceptance.
The [dispatch cache runtime comparison](../reports/2026-09-06-qwen36-dispatch-cache-comparison.md)
retains three matched pairs per MTP mode, exact complete trajectories and
chunk-aware delivered throughput, with mixed normal-MTP timing preserved.

For isolated Qwen3.6 attention geometry, run
`swift test --skip-build --filter 'CBv2PagedKernelTests/qwen36'` in the prepared
native package after building its tests. Require all 13 expanded cases and no
skips, then run `CBv2PagedKernelTests`, `CBv2PagedSegmentTests`, and
`CBv2PagedNativeDTypeTests` to cover the existing fixtures. Swift Testing filters
also match source filenames: the last filter includes two
`CBv2NativeKVTypeProbeTests` functions in the same file. Preserve actual suite and
case counts, numerical observations and failures. The [geometry validation record](../reports/2026-09-05-qwen36-attention-geometry.md)
distinguishes synthetic attention/storage coverage from real-model output parity.

For the corresponding unit tests, use the native nested-suite procedure above
with `CBv2PagedPrefixBlockCacheTests`, `CBv2PagedPrefixLeakTests`,
`CBv2PagedPoolGuardTests`, `CBv2FirstTokenWorkProjectionTests`,
`CBv2FirstTokenDeadlineEngineTests`, `CBv2TokenRadixIndexTests`,
`CBv2HybridPrefixCacheTests`, `CBv2RecurrentStateTests`,
`CBv2CompleteCheckpointTests`, and `CBv2CompleteCheckpointEngineTests`. Filters name the
declared test types, which can differ from filenames; the replay-plan class is
`CBv2FrozenReplayPlanTests`. MTP checkpoint checks also use
`Qwen35MTPDraftTrimTests` and `CBv2QwenMTPIntegrationTests`. Provider integration
filters include `EngineV2BridgeTests`, `EngineV2KVBackendGateTests`,
`PrefixCacheReceiptTests`, `SSDPrefixCache`, `ResidentPrefixCacheEvidenceTests`,
`SSDNativePrefixBuilderTests`, `SSDHybridCheckpointStoreTests`, and
`SSDCheckpointStageReservationTests`.
Use `EngineV2BridgePumpReceiptTests` for the real-engine submission/receipt
lifetime and cancellation regression; the [baseline failure and corrected-run evidence](../reports/2026-09-05-prefix-receipt-pump-ownership.md)
records its exact source and validation scope.

**Prompt parity** — `./scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh` proves the three
prompt-contract implementations agree on the same production vectors; the
procedure, its inputs and the regeneration flow are in
[step 9](#9-prompt-contract-parity-fixtures-and-vectors).

**Installer** — `./scripts/test-install-atomic.sh` exercises the atomic
install/replace path of `scripts/install.sh` in a temp dir (and runs
`scripts/sync-install-embed.sh check` first).

### 5. Web UIs

```bash
make ui-test                     # cd console-ui && npm test  (vitest run)
make ui-lint                     # npx eslint src/
make ui-build                    # next build
cd admin-ui && npm test && npm run lint && npm run build
make landing                    # standalone install, lint, build and HTTP route tests
```

The path-filtered `.github/workflows/landing.yml` workflow runs `npm ci`,
lint, the production build (including TypeScript checks), and `npm test`.
The Node test suite in `landing/tests/routes.test.mjs` starts an isolated
production server to verify pages, legacy redirects, assets and unconfigured
API responses without production credentials or upstream requests. For a
migration or deployment, start it on port `3008` and check `/`, `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, the
`/docs` redirect, fonts/media, desktop and mobile scrolling, and chat states.
Verify `/api/network` and `/api/about` against the configured upstreams;
without a key, `/api/chat` should return `503`. Exercise story delivery with
a test webhook rather than sending test submissions to the production inbox.

### 6. Scripts and release integrity

`python3 scripts/test_operations_scripts.py` checks admin JSON fields, fleet
partial-failure exit status and smoke-file ownership using stub transports. It
makes no network request, writes no login token and updates no host.

```bash
make benchmark-wrapper-test        # python3 -m unittest discover -s gemma_contbatch/tests -t .   (in scripts/)
./scripts/check-release-version.sh # ProviderCore.version == coordinator LatestProviderVersion (see operations/provider-release.md)
python3 scripts/test-provider-release-resolution.py # signed-validation and publication routing before credentials
./scripts/sync-install-embed.sh check   # coordinator/api/install.sh byte-identical to scripts/install.sh
./scripts/test-prod-env-refresh.sh      # deploy/gcp/prod/refresh-env.sh contract
./scripts/test-publish-model.sh         # scripts/publish-model.sh dry-run contract
```

Version checks, release routing, installer parity and production environment refresh
run in CI job "Release Integrity". The production env refresh test checks automatic
payout activation, preservation of an explicit off switch, and rejection of missing
payout prerequisites before the live env is changed.

For GPT-OSS profiling, first build a release benchmark binary and identify its
loaded Metal library and the exact downloaded model snapshot. Run on an idle
Apple Silicon host; the runner executes one cell process at a time and records
host state before and after each cell. The runner does not build or stop other
processes. Set the paths below to those artifacts, then run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=scripts python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/gptoss_profile/tests -v
python3 scripts/profile-gptoss.py run \
  --binary "$GPTOSS_BENCHMARK_BINARY" --metallib "$GPTOSS_METALLIB" \
  --model-dir "$GPTOSS_MODEL_SNAPSHOT" --output artifacts/gptoss-profile/baseline \
  --phase decode --cells decode-512-b1,decode-512-b2,decode-512-b4
python3 scripts/profile-gptoss.py summarize artifacts/gptoss-profile/baseline
```

Omit `--phase` and `--cells` for the full prefill/decode/arrival matrix; defaults
are five measured repetitions and 256 decode tokens. Prefix caching and MTP
are absent from the benchmark factory. The wrapper also disables their process
flags, clears inherited experimental controls, and uses an empty default TOML
unless `--config` is supplied. `--build-receipt` records the supplied build
receipt hash; the current source fingerprint alone does not establish how a
binary was built. The matrix manifest pins the iteration count, decode budget,
and KV backend; changing any of these requires a new output directory, even
when adding different cell names. The binary, metallibs, config, build receipt,
and full model inventory/content hashes are rechecked before and after each
new cell, outside its timing interval. Source: `scripts/gptoss_profile/runner.py` (`execute`),
`scripts/gptoss_profile/config.py` (`cells`, `environment`).

Verify `summary.json` has no failed cells and inspect `summary.csv`,
`summary.md`, and the raw per-cell output. Decode headlines use the common
host-observed interval in which every row is decoding, require at least 32
tokens from each row, and report aggregate/B separately from actual row rates.
This timing does not prove scheduler batch occupancy. Failed or changed
artifacts are not silently reused; use a new output directory for different
provenance or `--rerun` to archive and repeat an identical cell. Instrumented
runs require `--mode diagnostic` and a separate output directory. Source:
`scripts/gptoss_profile/validation.py` (`validate`),
`scripts/gptoss_profile/summary.py` (`summarize`).

For paired prefill or decode comparisons, create a schema-1 design with two
arms (`A`, `B`), explicit binary/metallib/build receipt paths, identical context
length and phase, and explicit environment overrides. Run
`PYTHONPATH=scripts python3 -m gptoss_profile.controls <design.json> --output <directory> --cycles 2`.
Prefill uses `cell: {"phase":"prefill","context":8192,"batch":1}` and compares
TTFT; decode compares aggregate common-window throughput and output hashes.
Prefill token parity is explicitly unavailable in this report schema. Keep
numerical/KV tests separate from uninstrumented timing. The decode warmup now
uses the requested generation length so long prompts can establish the full
batch before measured work. Failed construction, submission, terminals or token
counts in any warmup abort the sweep before decode measurements. Schema 7 submits requests in row-index order before
concurrently consuming their streams; validation checks the recorded order and
timestamps. Batched decode requires schema 7; historical schema-6 raw data remains
available but is rejected for new performance comparisons, including when
re-summarizing saved ABBA runs. Legacy single-row schema 6 remains accepted.
Scaling ratios also require matching backend, decode budget and iteration count
when reading older manifests without the matrix workload field.
This prevents task scheduling from silently changing admission order. Sources: `scripts/gptoss_profile/controls.py`
(`execute_controls`), `scripts/gptoss_profile/control_report.py`
(`summarize_controls`), `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/ThroughputSweep.swift`
(`measureDecode`). See [GPT-OSS optimization results](../reports/2026-09-05-gptoss20b-optimization-results.md).

### 7. Docs lint

Long-prompt throughput qualification must retain both MLX active/cache counters
and an independent OS process-footprint sample. The sweep applies the serving
allocator guard before loading (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/ThroughputSweep.swift`,
`run`); `MLXMemoryGuardTests` cover the shared limit policy. A large unbounded
reuse pool is not live KV. Rerun identical prompt/token budgets and compare token
IDs when changing allocation policy; do not reduce state precision to hide growth.

The lightweight Contribution Policy workflow runs before review and again when
the `docs-not-needed` label is added or removed. Its `Commit Signatures` job
queries GitHub's pull-request commit list and requires
`commit.verification.verified = true` for every commit. This covers commits on
contributor forks, which the protected branch's signed-commit rule does not
evaluate.

Its `Docs Impact` job runs:

```bash
make docs-impact-check BASE=origin/master
```

`scripts/docs-impact-check.py` compares the branch with the merge base and
applies `scripts/docs-impact-rules.json`. A documentation-sensitive source
change must update one of that rule's canonical docs. Matching multiple rules
requires satisfying each rule. Test-only files are ignored. A maintainer can
apply `docs-not-needed` when a mapped source change does not alter documented
behavior; the PR must explain the exception in its Documentation impact
section.

The historical-link regression checks run in isolated temporary Git repositories:

```bash
python3 scripts/test-docs-check-historical-links.py
```

Docs Lint also runs these checks before validating the documentation tree.
Frozen source references resolve against the exact stamped commit when the
file has moved; current missing links still fail. See
[historical source references](historical-references.md).

```bash
make docs-check          # scripts/docs-check.sh — stamps, relative links, cited paths, orphans
make docs-stamp FILES="docs/developer/test.md"   # refresh a stamp after editing
```

### 8. End-to-end suite

The e2e package (`e2e/`, harness in `e2e/testbed/`) boots ephemeral Postgres,
a coordinator from the current tree, and one or more **real** `darkbloom`
provider processes serving MLX checkpoints, then drives the OpenAI-compatible
API. It is a Go test binary; run it from the repo root with `-p=1` (suites
share GPU/ports).

```bash
# Blocking lane as CI runs it (paged KV @ 8, engine-reported backend asserted):
DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_KV_BACKEND=paged DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_MAX_CONCURRENT=8 \
DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_EXPECT_KV_BACKEND=paged \
go test ./e2e/ -count=1 -v -timeout 25m -p=1 \
  -run 'TestIntegration|TestProfile' -skip '^TestIntegrationExactCacheRouting$'

# Default posture (no TOML written; .auto resolves contiguous as of v0.8.1):
DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_EXPECT_KV_BACKEND=contiguous \
go test ./e2e/ -count=1 -v -timeout 10m -p=1 -run '^TestIntegration_(NonStreaming|Streaming)Inference$'

make e2e-integration     # go test ./e2e/... -run TestIntegration -v   (no posture pins)
make e2e-benchmark       # go test ./e2e/... -run TestBenchmark -v
```

The harness builds the provider itself (`e2e/testbed/provider.go`,
`BuildProvider`): `swift build -c release` (or `TESTBED_PROVIDER_CONFIG=debug`)
and stages `mlx.metallib`, unless `DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY` points at a
binary that already has `mlx.metallib` beside it.

| Env var | Read in | Effect |

| `DARKBLOOM_REPO_ROOT` | `e2e/testbed/suite.go` | Repo root (auto-detected from cwd when unset) |
| `DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY` | `e2e/testbed/provider.go` | Use this provider binary instead of building; needs `mlx.metallib` beside it |
| `TESTBED_PROVIDER_CONFIG` | `e2e/testbed/provider.go` | `release` (default) or `debug` SwiftPM configuration for the built provider |
| `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_MODEL` / `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_MODEL_B` | `e2e/testbed/config.go` | Override the default (`mlx-community/gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4-Q8`) and secondary (`mlx-community/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-4bit`) checkpoints; must be CBv2-servable |
| `TESTBED_MODEL_ID` | `e2e/testbed/suite.go` | Per-suite model override |
| `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_KV_BACKEND` | `e2e/testbed/config.go` (`ResolveKVBackend`) | `auto` / `paged` / `contiguous` written to the provider TOML as `engine_v2_kv_backend`; unset = provider default |
| `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_MAX_CONCURRENT` | `e2e/testbed/config.go` (`ResolveMaxConcurrent`) | `engine_v2_max_concurrent`; unset = the provider default ([`../provider/cli-reference.md`](../provider/cli-reference.md#providertoml-keys-read-by-the-cli)); malformed value is a hard error |
| `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_EXPECT_KV_BACKEND` | `e2e/testbed/kv_expectation.go` | Pre-warm every slot and fail unless the heartbeat's `kv_backend` equals this |
| `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_KV` | `e2e/testbed/config.go` | Provider fleet kill switch; CI refuses to run the paged gate when it is set |
| `DARKBLOOM_PROMPT_SIDECAR_BINARY` | `e2e/exact_cache_routing_test.go` | Path to a built `promptsidecar` for exact-cache routing |
| `DARKBLOOM_EXACT_CACHE_TEST_MODEL` | `e2e/exact_cache_routing_test.go` | Override the exact-cache fixture (`mlx-community/gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit`) |
| `DARKBLOOM_EXACT_CACHE_RECURRENT_MODEL` | `e2e/exact_cache_recurrent_test.go` | Opt-in: a cached `qwen3_5` or `qwen3_5_moe` checkpoint (for example `EigenLabs/Qwen3.5-9B-MLX-4bit-mtp`) for the recurrent company-leaves lane; skipped when unset. The suite sets `PrefixCacheMode: "ssd"` because the provider enables the SSD cache by default only for production catalog IDs |
| `DARKBLOOM_QWEN38_E2E`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN38_MTP_PATH`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN38_MTP_MANIFEST_PATH`, `DARKBLOOM_QWEN38_MTP_REVISION` | `e2e/integration_test.go` | Opt-in Qwen3.8 real-process tools/video lane with a local MTP build |
| `DARKBLOOM_FULL_NETWORK_SMOKE` | `e2e/integration_test.go` | Opt-in full-network multi-model routing smoke |
| `BENCHMARK_MD_PATH` | `e2e/benchmark_test.go` | Where `TestBenchmark*` writes the Markdown results table |

**Inventory** (`rg '^func Test' e2e/*.go` is authoritative):

| File | Tests |
|---|---|
| `e2e/integration_test.go` | `TestIntegration_NonStreamingInference`, `_StreamingInference`, `_GreedyDeterminism`, `_MultipleRequestsAccounting`, `_E2EEncryptionCorrectness`, `_BillingBalanceDeduction`, `_ProviderPayoutSplit`, `_InsufficientBalance`, `_InvalidModel`, `_StreamingContentValidation`, `_ConcurrentRequests`, `_AttestationHeaders`, `_SwiftProviderRealRoutingGates`, `_FullNetworkSingleSwiftProviderMultiModelRouting`, `_ReferralRewardDistribution`, `_Qwen38RealProcessToolsAndVideo`; plus `TestQwen38GatePolicy`, `TestQwen38ExpectedBuiltKVBackend` |

### 9. Prompt-contract parity fixtures and vectors

For the registry-ID/native-context follow-up, run `Qwen4SupportPolicyTests`,
`Qwen4OwnedVLMRoutingTests`, `Qwen4ToolChoicePromptPolicyTests`,
`Qwen4ReasoningEffortValidationTests` and `PromptContractIdentityTests` against
the freshly built provider test product. These cover both exact serving IDs,
foreign-ID rejection, native prompt-plus-output boundaries, no second clamp on
other models, media factory selection and native tool/reasoning policy. Rust
`qwen4_native_tool_prompt` and Go `TestQwen4Catalog` tests cover the mirrors and
mixed-fleet version floor. Require nonzero executed counts and no hidden skips.

Normalization v6 requires regenerated contract/cache hashes; compare all
existing production vectors' request/provider bodies, template inputs and token
arrays against v5 before accepting the update. The shared corpus does not
include the full Flash-Next artifact: these checks are not full-model API,
262K memory, multimodal or MTP qualification. Record those gates separately.

`fixtures/prompt-contract/v1` is shared by the Rust, Go and Swift
prompt-contract tests: `contract_vectors.json` and `block_hash_vectors.json`
(identity and chain vectors), `corpus.json` (complete requests for tools, null
sanitization, Harmony and Gemma normalization, reasoning effort, Unicode, all
four endpoints, exact block multiples, long prompts, response formats and
multiple system turns),
`tool_choice_parallel_vectors.json` (16 exact required/named/auto/none
instruction cases across omitted/null/true/false parallel controls, consumed by
`CachePromptParityTests.parallelToolInstructionVectors` and Rust
`tool_choice_parallel.rs`),
`native_reasoning_vectors.json` (25 shared context/error cases for native
Qwen4 reasoning ON/OFF, typed effort precedence and legacy-model preservation,
consumed by `CachePromptParityTests.nativeReasoningContextVectors` and Rust
`cache_prompt_parity.rs`),
`production_vectors.json` (per-model normalized bodies, token IDs and
boundaries) and `manifests/` (the catalog snapshot the vectors were generated
from). Production tokenizer/template/config artifacts are **not** in the
repository; the vectors are generated only from manifest-pinned,
coordinator-provisioned artifacts. What the vectors protect is explained in
[`../architecture/prompt-contract-sidecar.md`](../architecture/prompt-contract-sidecar.md#parity-fixtures-and-measured-latency).

The pinned inventory contains seven artifacts: the five release models and two
additional Gemma variants. All 18 shared cases run against every artifact,
producing 154 token-array and scoped-hash comparisons. The common corpus uses
histories and reasoning settings accepted by each family; family-specific argument and
Harmony regressions remain in the provider's focused test suites.

**Run the gate** (what CI's Provider Tests job runs; needs Go, `cargo +1.88.0`,
Swift and `jq`):

```bash
./scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh
```

The script, in order:

1. Replays the committed manifest snapshot through
   `go run ./cmd/promptfixtureinput --manifest-source-directory
   fixtures/prompt-contract/v1/manifests …` (from `coordinator/`), which
   downloads only the verified prompt artifacts into a temporary artifact root
   (override with `PROMPT_PARITY_ARTIFACT_ROOT`; artifacts come from
   `PROMPT_PARITY_CDN_URL`).
2. Regenerates the vectors with the Rust generator:

   ```bash
   cargo +1.88.0 run --locked --quiet \
     --manifest-path coordinator/promptsidecar/Cargo.toml \
     --bin prompt-fixtures -- \
     --manifest-directory "$MANIFEST_DIR" \
     --artifact-root "$ARTIFACT_ROOT" \
     --cases fixtures/prompt-contract/v1/corpus.json \
     --output "$WORK/production_vectors.json"
   ```

   `prompt-fixtures` (`coordinator/promptsidecar/src/bin/prompt-fixtures.rs`)
   also accepts one `--manifest <file>` per model instead of
   `--manifest-directory`. The corpus supplies a fixed request-owned UTC date;
   direct literal date calls use it in both renderers. Unsupported clock use
   is written with `cache_routing_eligible: false` and
   `ineligibility_reason: "dynamic_time"` and get no routable vectors.
3. `cmp`s the generated file byte-for-byte against
   `fixtures/prompt-contract/v1/production_vectors.json`.
4. Runs the three implementations against the same vectors: Swift
   `swift test --package-path provider-swift --filter ProductionPromptParityTests`
   (with `PROMPT_PARITY_REQUIRED=1`, `PROMPT_PARITY_VECTORS`,
   `PROMPT_PARITY_ARTIFACT_ROOT` set), Go
   `go test ./promptcontract -run TestProductionPlansConsumeSharedTokenVectors`,
   and Rust `--test shared_vectors production_plans_match_shared_token_vectors`
   plus `--test planner_fixture concurrent_cold_contract_load_is_singleflight`.
5. Builds the release `promptsidecar` and drives it through the real Go
   supervisor with `go run ./coordinator/cmd/promptsidecarloadproof`
   (`PROMPT_LOAD_PROOF_DURATION`, `PROMPT_LOAD_PROOF_QPS`,
   `PROMPT_LOAD_PROOF_MAX_RSS_MIB` tune the run), failing on any plan mismatch,
   timeout, overload, restart, child replacement or RSS escape.
   Preserve the reported cold-load, preload and warm-plan timing totals and
   counts alongside memory measurements. Compute means from totals and counts;
   histogram buckets are cumulative bounds, not exact latency quantiles. When
   comparing tokenizer ownership, use identical artifacts, vectors and proof
   binaries in both arms. A macOS RSS pass does not prove Linux's address-space
   limit; run `scripts/verify-prompt-sidecar-linux.sh` against the static musl
   binary before release.

**Regenerate the fixtures** after a catalog, normalisation, renderer or
tokenizer change:

```bash
PROMPT_PARITY_UPDATE=1 ./scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh
```

This re-fetches every active public manifest from `PROMPT_PARITY_CATALOG_URL`
(default `https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/models/catalog`), rewrites
`fixtures/prompt-contract/v1/manifests/` and `production_vectors.json`, then
runs the same parity tests against the new vectors. Commit both. Missing
models, artifacts or corpus cases and unrecognised template incompatibilities
fail the gate (`require_model_manifests`, `require_case_ids`); no fabricated
token IDs are accepted.

## Verify

- `make test` exits 0 and `docs-check` prints `N file(s) OK`.
- `swift test` output lists the `ProviderCore` suites **and** each nested suite
  step prints a non-zero executed count (the tripwire in `run-nested-suite.sh`).
- The e2e run logs `postgres started`, one `using configured provider binary`
  or provider build line per provider, and finishes with `ok  github.com/eigeninference/d-inference/e2e`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL not set — skipping PostgreSQL integration test` | store tests skipped | export `DATABASE_URL` to a Postgres 16 with a `testbed` database |
| `neither docker nor postgres found in PATH` | e2e cannot start Postgres | start Docker, or put `postgresql@16/bin` on `PATH` |

## GPT-OSS complete-checkpoint reconstruction

On an owned idle Apple Silicon host, build the optimized provider tests with the
pinned dependencies and source-matched metallib described in [build.md](build.md).
Point the fixture at the verified exact `gpt-oss-20b` catalog snapshot; the helper
hashes it before and after loading and rejects any other aggregate. Run only this
fixture, with MTP and resident caching left at their production defaults:

```bash
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GPTOSS_CHECKPOINT_RESTART=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GPTOSS_MODEL_DIRECTORY=/absolute/verified-gpt-oss-20b \
  swift test -c release --force-resolved-versions -Xswiftc -enable-testing \
    --no-parallel --filter GPTOSSCheckpointRestartLiveTests
```

`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/GPTOSS/GPTOSSCheckpointRestartLiveTests.swift`
(`sameKeyNewEngineRestoresBranchedPrompt`; the same file also gates
`batchedDonorRestoresDeepBoundary`, whose donor starts solo and gains decode
company and must restore at least 5,120 of about 6,400 tokens,
`growingConversationRestoresDeepest`, and `forkedPromptRestoresHintedBoundary`,
which restores the boundary a coordinator hint named) donates a complete encrypted historical
checkpoint, shuts down the engine/store, reconstructs both and requests a branched
prompt first. It requires disk reads, exact checkpoint-boundary hit accounting,
expected answer markers, tenant and changed-prefix misses, cache-off controls,
and retired staging/write reservations. TTFT and exact-text equality are recorded;
one run is not a general performance or answer-quality claim. The fixture uses
an isolated temporary root, one ephemeral key retained across reconstruction,
and test runtime identity. It does not prove provider-process restart, production
keychain recovery or cross-binary reuse.

For concurrent requests with different suffixes, run the separate mixed-prefix
gate on the same owned host, with production TF32 defaults:

```bash
cd provider-swift
env -u MLX_ENABLE_TF32 \
  DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 \
  DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GPTOSS_MIXED_PREFIX=1 \
  DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GPTOSS_MODEL_DIRECTORY=/absolute/verified-gpt-oss-20b \
  swift test -c release --force-resolved-versions -Xswiftc -enable-testing \
    --no-parallel --filter GPTOSSMixedPrefixCacheLiveTests
```

The model-directory variable is optional when the exact verified snapshot is
already discoverable in the local cache.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/GPTOSS/GPTOSSMixedPrefixCacheLiveTests.swift`
(`concurrentSuffixesRemainIsolated`) compares cache-off controls with restored
branches in B2/B4 cohorts, reverses the B2 request order, and submits a four-request
mixture of matching prefixes, a changed early fact and another tenant.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/Fixtures/GPTOSSMixedPrefixCohort.swift` (`run`)
submits through the real bridge and requires completed native target-decode
observations at widths two and four for the restored B2/B4 cohorts. The cold
`off-four-submitted` control and mixed four-request cohorts require at least
width two: full prefills can stagger short natural answers, so four admissions
do not establish cold decode width four. All observed widths remain in the
retained deltas. This semantic/isolation gate does not establish matched
full-width-four cache-on/cache-off parity or performance; paired performance
benchmarks retain their own actual-width requirements. Each warm cohort must
restore both distinct suffixes; extra duplicate rows may safely miss. Store
consumptions must reconcile with observed hits. Every request must return its
own answer and hit/miss accounting, finish naturally and retire admission/KV
reservations. The same ephemeral-key limits
apply. First-observed chunk times can include buffered output and are not
benchmark TTFT; exact-text comparisons are diagnostic. This invocation describes
the gate and does not assert that it passed.

The focused construction and load-policy suites are `GPTOSSDefaultPrefixCacheWiringTests`,
`PrefixCachePolicyTests` and `PrefixCacheLoadHashTests` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/PrefixCache/`. They cover exact-ID activation, disabled
and unsupported backends, fresh load hashes and identity rejection. A passing
construction suite does not replace the real-checkpoint fixture above. Live test
skips must be reported as unrun qualification.

## Qwen recurrent checkpoint retention (live)

`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/Qwen/Qwen35CheckpointRetentionLiveTests.swift`
drives real Qwen weights through the production paged assembly (bridge, SSD
complete-checkpoint store, inline MTP head when the artifact embeds one) and
checks chunk-agnostic capture, fork-target retention, restore text against a
cold control, and the company-leaves shape (six 512-token chunks, then the
2,048-token stripe). Gates and overrides:

```bash
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN35_CHECKPOINT_RETENTION=1 \
swift test --filter Qwen35CheckpointRetentionLiveTests
# MoE sanity run (needs both gates):
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN35_CHECKPOINT_RETENTION=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN36_MOE_CHECKPOINT=1 \
swift test --filter Qwen35CheckpointRetentionLiveTests/moePartitionSanity
```

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN_RETENTION_MODEL` | Another cached `qwen3_5` checkpoint for the dense runs (default `EigenLabs/Qwen3.5-9B-MLX-4bit-mtp`). A `language_model_only` artifact loads without VLM extraction |
| `DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN_MOE_MODEL` | Another cached `qwen3_5_moe` checkpoint for the MoE run (default Qwen3.6-35B-A3B; Qwen3.5-35B-A3B is the same architecture) |
| `DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN_RETENTION_BUDGET_GIB` | Dense-run slot budget in GiB (default 32) |

The suite pins the solo stripe at 2,048 tokens; production dense Qwen stripes
at 4,096. `EigenLabs/Qwen3.8-27B-MTP-4bit` is the standalone MTP-head
artifact, not a model; and the Qwen3.8-27B builds are gated to Apple M5 with
NAX in the provider (`ModelRuntimeRequirements`), so on other chips the
fixture bypasses a product gate and trips the 30-second engine step watchdog
in prefill. Results and the parity evidence behind the capture rule:
[2026-09-27 report](../reports/2026-09-27-qwen-chunk-partition-parity.md).

## Connected coordinator/provider HTTP cache gate

For a focused release-default check, use
`e2e/release_defaults_http_test.go` (`TestIntegrationReleaseDefaultsHTTP`).
Prepare an exact artifact/runtime input using the shared connected input schema,
with backend and MTP mode both `auto` and the model's expected cache mode. Leave
provider cache overrides unset. Run on one owned idle host:

```bash
DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_DEFAULT_INPUT=/absolute/defaults.json \
DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_DEFAULT_OUTPUT=/absolute/new-defaults-output \
  go test ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationReleaseDefaultsHTTP$' -count=1 -timeout=15m
```

The two B1 requests check actual paged activation, automatic MTP selection,
complete cold/repeat output and token accounting, and model-scoped cache
capability. Qwen and exact `gpt-oss-20b` require a ready SSD capability and an
accepted repeat hit; GPT-OSS still requires MTP inactivity under automatic
selection. The older Gemma QAT helper retains its cache-inactive expectation and
does not qualify the current Gemma default. The report retains the actual
generated provider configuration. This smoke does not establish raw token-ID
parity, concurrent widths, cancellation, restart, or selection between providers;
run the corresponding native and connected gates separately. CPU helper checks:

```bash
go test -short ./e2e ./e2e/testbed \
  -run 'TestReleaseDefault|TestReleaseCapability|TestProviderLaunchDefaultCache' -count=1
```

For the remaining release tools and image paths, use
`e2e/release_capabilities_http_test.go` (`TestIntegrationReleaseCapabilitiesHTTP`)
with the same exact connected input schema. Set
`DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_CAPABILITIES_INPUT` and
`DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_CAPABILITIES_OUTPUT` to the frozen input and a fresh output
directory, then select that test explicitly. It runs one original tool request
for each selected model and one hash-bound image request for Qwen 3.5, Qwen 3.6
or Gemma QAT; GPT-OSS has no image case. Run each model separately on the owned
host. The shared setup preserves automatic backend/MTP and model-scoped cache
defaults. The test validates complete tool arguments, image-path handling,
stream termination and token accounting. Qwen 3.8 is excluded from this bounded
supplement because its full connected routing fixture already includes tools
and vision. Neither test's process success constitutes broad answer-quality
acceptance; apply the [release acceptance criteria](../design/release-090-acceptance.md).

The opt-in `ReleaseCoResidencyLiveTests` suite covers the exact Qwen 3.6,
GPT-OSS 20B and Gemma 4 QAT artifacts in three live slots. Set
`DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_CORESIDENCY_CONFIG` to the reviewed fixture and
`DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_CORESIDENCY_CONFIG_SHA256` to its SHA256, then select only
`ReleaseCoResidencyLiveTests` in the separately built, owned test runner.
The fixture binds model paths, canonical prompt tokens, metallib and isolated
ephemeral cache paths; its declared operator memory cap must match the
environment. It uses detected hardware and normal admission/MTP/cache policy.
After measured Qwen SSD prefix consumption, it requires real generation during
each newcomer load and grant shrink, then cancellation, reservation drain,
recovery and grant growth after unload. Cleanup is awaited on failure as well
as success. This checks generation/load overlap after restore, not concurrent
SSD I/O. The suite skips ordinary CI when no fixture is supplied; a release run
must execute its one test with no skips and retain the complete cleanup report.
The harness is prepared; these instructions do not claim a completed live run.

Owned two-host startup waits up to five minutes for the existing GPU ≤42°C
and load1 ≤4 entry thresholds. Identity, disk, nonfinite measurements and
foreign processes still refuse immediately. Lease pings and cancellation
cover preparation; EOF, stop, signals or deadlines prevent a later launch.
The owned credential is retired after its provider group is confirmed gone,
before independent host observation. A foreign-process or telemetry failure
still fails the run; `auth_token_retired` and the separate owned
`credential-retirement.json` record keep credential cleanup distinct.

Catalog inputs use `testbed.CatalogModel.Entry` (`store.ModelRegistryEntry`),
not the public API projection from `catalogModelFromRegistryRecord`. Prepare
inputs through the opt-in, CPU-only `TestPrepareConnectedInputBindings` check
with `DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_INPUT_BINDING_PLAN`. It retains the original public
metadata, checks the complete input/report roundtrip, and preserves all
consumed policy fields and the immutable manifest. Catalog comparison remains
part of the exact input gate; ignored public fields must not be silently lost.

Reports retain `host_lifecycles` for failed and unattempted targets, including
readiness observations, helper/fixture identities, `provider_started`, and
terminal/cleanup receipts. A valid terminal can prove provider startup when its
start acknowledgement was lost; successful startup still requires the acknowledgement.
Without an acknowledgement or valid terminal, `provider_started` is null.
Contradictory identities remain explicit errors; an acknowledged start stays recorded.
A started Go/helper fixture is not evidence that
a provider started, and a refused startup remains a failed correctness run.


`TestIntegrationConnectedCacheHTTP` extends the existing real-provider testbed with
an opt-in ten-case HTTP gate. It starts an isolated in-memory coordinator, two
normal authenticated provider WebSocket connections, and the real supervised Rust
prompt sidecar. Local API keys, provider tokens and the routing master key are
fresh fixture credentials. No production database, Privy, Stripe or deployment
secret is needed. Testbed trust overrides are explicit; this is not attestation or
persistent-key restart evidence. Two providers on one Mac establish connected
control-plane behavior, not independent-machine capacity or latency.

For two independent machines, supply the optional `providers` array described
in the [owned-host fixture reference](../../e2e/testbed/OWNED_HOSTS.md). This uses
the existing loopback relay and owned SSH tunnel, and selects the five-case
`two_host_base_routing` scope. Follow its exact runtime/model inventories,
account binding, fresh-root and entry/cleanup requirements. The
[source integration record](../reports/2026-09-06-two-host-connected-fixture.md)
contains the CPU/race results; it is not an actual two-host model run.

Prepare `DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_INPUT` as the JSON input described by
`connectedCacheInput` in `e2e/connected_cache_input_test.go`: exact target catalog
entry and immutable manifest, current artifact tuple, verified prompt artifact
directory, provider/metallib/sidecar paths and SHA-256 values, explicit backend,
`cache_mode` (`off` or `ssd`), normal MTP mode, authored text/tool fixtures and
per-slot concurrency. Gemma requires its verified flat assistant directory and
an external assistant catalog manifest; the directory itself contains only
config and safetensors files. GPT-OSS uses MTP off and the three exact Qwen models
use MTP on. The normal production loader still verifies assistant compatibility.
Vision-configured artifacts require the original `landing/assets/cube-hero.png`
fixture and its pinned hash. The supplied text must tokenize to at least 2,048
tokens through the real sidecar, leaving room above the unchanged SSD hit floor.
No latest-snapshot discovery or artifact-name substitution occurs.
For the exact prepared five-artifact package, use ordinary `tool_choice: auto`
with explicit call instructions; the fixture checks actual tool name and arguments.
None of these exact artifacts advertises enforced named constraints, including
the Gemma artifact whose template differs from the pinned constraint contract.
Use the [reviewed revision 2 inputs](../reports/2026-09-05-connected-cache-inputs-revision2.md)
for the corrected Gemma assistant path and SSE reasoning-alias reader. Its
launcher verifies the actual declared assistant directory against the external
manifest. The package retains the original CLI/native revision; final release
validation requires a fresh paired package with the final runtime hashes.
Regenerate and review inputs plus CPU plans if the request-owned UTC date changes;
keep frozen packages and failed connected evidence unchanged.

Use a dedicated idle host and the final prebuilt provider plus colocated runtime
resources and Rust sidecar. This gate never builds them. It requires an existing
canonical provider config, verifies its bytes remain unchanged, and refuses a
provider binary with keychain access-group entitlement. Runtime files are copied
into the new output directory; PID/state/local discovery/cache/temporary/guard
paths are isolated, automatic updates and restarts are disabled, and the two exact
retired telemetry queue files must be absent. It never removes or repairs a host
configuration or key. SSD uses an explicitly ephemeral test key and fresh per-process
roots; resident cache and unrelated memory/backend overrides must be unset.

```bash
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_INPUT=/absolute/off.json \
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_OUTPUT=/absolute/new-off-output \
  go test ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationConnectedCacheHTTP$' -count=1 -timeout=45m
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_INPUT=/absolute/ssd.json \
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_OUTPUT=/absolute/new-ssd-output \
  go test ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationConnectedCacheHTTP$' -count=1 -timeout=45m
python3 scripts/benchmarks/compare_connected_cache_http.py \
  /absolute/new-off-output/report.json /absolute/new-ssd-output/report.json \
  --output /absolute/connected-comparison.json
```

The pair must use the same final binary, exact artifacts, backend, normal MTP,
authored request bytes and coordinator-owned UTC date. The comparator checks
served content/reasoning, decoded tool arguments, finish and native/HTTP token
counts; timing-dependent cancellation partial lengths are retained separately.
The runner fences UTC rollover and preserves failed, running and unrun cells in
an atomically replaced partial JSON report. Keep the `go test` log beside it for
setup failures and interrupted process evidence.

A bounded transparent loopback relay records negotiation, checkpoint echo,
receipt positions, cancellation and typed terminal usage/profile without keys,
nonces, raw scopes, token-chain hashes or encrypted bodies. Actual coordinator
acceptance counters and existing scheduler decisions are checked separately.
A read/receipt alone cannot pass the native saved-token hit assertion. The cases
cover cold donation, repeat, tenant isolation, a continuation on another provider,
original-prefix routing, supported tool execution, vision remaining cold, restored
cancellation and recovery, and sidecar-unavailable cold serving. Loaded slots must
report the actual backend with no fallback, and terminal profiles must prove MTP.
Heartbeat memory/SSD read observations are snapshots, not per-request read-byte
measurements. Old-echo, expiry/eviction, reconnect, queued revocation and costly-hit
winner controls remain separate coordinator gates. This harness source and its
loopback fixtures do not themselves establish real-model results.

The [HTTP6 execution record](../reports/2026-09-06-connected-http6-canceled-prefix.md)
passes all ten Qwen3.8 cache-off and SSD cases with the unchanged strict comparator.
Cancellation preserves actual SSD adoption and its accepted lookup before one
terminal; recovery and sidecar outage also pass. This is one B1 pair on one host.

The [HTTP5 execution record](../reports/2026-09-06-connected-http5-cache-and-cancel.md)
retains real donation/hit coverage and the original canceled-settlement failure.
Frozen package verification includes executable permissions before model preflight.
The [cancellation settlement regression](../reports/2026-09-06-canceled-prefix-settlement.md)
records the deterministic real-engine negative control and passing provider fix.
Run `ProviderCancelledPrefixCacheTests` and `CancelledSettlementLifecycleTests` to
check native usage/lookup ordering, delivered-token billing, and pump retirement;
the separate real-model HTTP rerun remains required.

The helper checks run without Swift, Metal or model execution:

```bash
go test -race -short ./e2e/testbed ./e2e \
  -run 'TestProviderWire|TestProviderTOMLExplicit|TestConnected' -count=1
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks \
  -p 'test_compare_connected_cache_http.py'
```

### Two-host correctness-only continuation

Use `TestIntegrationConnectedCacheCorrectnessHTTP` when validating cache routing
and cancellation across two owned hosts. Prepare the same exact artifact/runtime
inputs and fresh roots described above, with two `providers` and explicit
`correctness_only: true`. Reserve both hosts before running; the existing cold
prelaunch, production admission and owned-process cleanup requirements still apply.

1. Run the cache-off input with the dedicated correctness variables:

   ```bash
   DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_CORRECTNESS_INPUT=/absolute/correctness-off.json \
   DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_CORRECTNESS_OUTPUT=/absolute/new-correctness-off \
     go test -v ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationConnectedCacheCorrectnessHTTP$' \
       -count=1 -timeout=25m
   ```

2. After cache-off passes, repeat with the paired SSD input, identical runtime,
   artifact and UTC date, and separate fresh provider/output roots. Stop on any
   failure and retain its original report and cleanup receipts.
3. Require report schema `3`, scope `two_host_cache_routing_correctness`, and seven
   passing cases: `cold_donor_a`, `same_prompt_a`, `tenant_isolation_a`,
   `continuation_b`, `original_after_continuation`, `cancel`, `after_cancel`.
   Compare content, reasoning, finish reason and HTTP/native counts for the six
   completed requests. Both canceled requests must independently prove native
   partial settlement and retirement; their streamed partial lengths may differ.

Between requests, this scope retains heat/load observations and requires owned
processes only, exact hardware/RAM, valid telemetry, free disk space and quiescent
model capacity. It does not require running providers to return to cold benchmark
heat/load thresholds (`e2e/connected_cache_correctness_test.go`,
`connectedHostEntryReady`; `connectedSlotsQuiescent`). Cache adoption, tenant,
capability, request/provider identity and cancellation validators remain shared
with the original fixture (`e2e/connected_cache_http_test.go`,
`runConnectedCacheHTTP`). This scope makes no latency, throughput, raw-token-ID,
production-attestation or persistent-key restart claim. The original measured
fixture rejects `correctness_only: true`; preserve its schema-2 evidence and use
a separately reviewed schema-3 comparator for this seven-case pair.

## App Attest release qualification

Run `go test ./appattest ./api ./store -run 'TestAppAttest|TestAuthorization|TestApple'`
from `coordinator/`, using a disposable local `DATABASE_URL` for the store
contracts (the test harness truncates tables). Add `-race` for concurrency checks.
Run `swift test --filter ProviderAppAttestTests` from `provider-swift/`.
The private admin queries have PostgreSQL coverage in
`admin-ui/src/lib/queries/app-attest.test.ts` and
`admin-ui/src/lib/queries/app-attest-diagnostics.test.ts`. These cover account-scoped
rotation recovery and aging historical APNs snapshots. `DeviceCheckProcessTests`
executes a child that ignores SIGTERM to verify bounded log collection.
`DeviceCheckExtractionBoundsTests` covers bounded file tails, oversized lines and
ring ordering; `ProviderRunMarkerTests` separates stale version markers from exact
exec identity, and informational doctor results remain non-failing under `--strict`.
`ReportPayloadTests` covers the combined upload-size limit, and an isolated idle
termination test checks that the run marker is clean before AppKit can exit.
`AppAttestLocalDiagnosisTests` covers APNs history below macOS 27 and missing
App Attest state.

After pushing a contribution, follow the [contributor skill](../../.agents/skills/darkbloom-contributor/SKILL.md#post-push-review-loop):
monitor reviews and checks on the current remote head, validate findings before
fixing them, and verify fixes are pushed before resolving threads. A passing
local suite does not establish that the post-push review cycle has completed.

After the optimized provider is packaged with its resources, run
`DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_CHUNK_EVAL=18 MLX_GEMMA4_FUSED_WEIGHTED_UNSORT=1 MLX_GATHER_QMM_EXPERT_SLICES=1 Darkbloom.app/Contents/MacOS/darkbloom runtime-smoke`
(the child validates retained latches that MLX reads at its first Metal touch,
so the caller seeds them, exactly as `SelfUpdater` and `install.sh` do). Require all four markers:
`app-attest-callback-runtime-smoke: ok`, `gemma-optimizations-runtime-smoke: ok`,
`paged-kernel-runtime-smoke: ok`, and `qwen4-metal-resources-runtime-smoke: ok`. Callback completion and expiry are exercised
without Apple service calls or a Keychain item. This linked-binary check catches
a release-only allocator failure that debug tests missed. Run
`bash scripts/test-install-atomic.sh` for installer acceptance and rollback cases.
The [rollout runbook](../operations/app-attest-rollout.md) separates these checks
from real Apple receipt renewal and final signed-artifact fleet qualification.

## Provider release toolchain

`python3 scripts/test-provider-release-toolchain.py` checks SDK selection, rejection of older SDK/compiler inputs, wrapper argument boundaries and propagation of `SDKROOT` without installing software. Release Integrity runs these tests. The signed provider workflow runs the provider unit suite and isolated allocator gates with the selected SDK 27 / Swift 6.4 toolchain before packaging; [provider release](../operations/provider-release.md) describes artifact qualification.

### Qwen packaged resource regression

`python3 scripts/test-qwen4-packaged-resources.py` compiles the actual Qwen Metal resource accessor into a small optimized app, then runs it from a relocated app and an installer-style executable symlink. It checks all three preamble hashes, rejects missing or empty files and resource links outside the app, and proves that developer/cwd copies cannot mask a broken packaged resource. It needs Swift on macOS, but no model weights or GPU. Both SDK 27 release lanes and Provider Tests run this check. The full provider `runtime-smoke` exercises the same accessor before publication, installation, and update.

## Model token promotion and SLA checks

`coordinator/api/model_token_pricing_test.go` checks exact input/output prices, fee shares, mixed paid/sponsored requests, overflow rejection, and 100 tiny completions with a lost commit acknowledgement. `coordinator/store/model_token_earnings_test.go` races fractional settlements and duplicate replays on both backends, rejects invalid fractions, and reopens PostgreSQL to verify remainder durability.

`coordinator/store/model_token_promotions_test.go` runs the grant/ledger contract on both memory and disposable PostgreSQL backends: one-time claims, day boundaries, concurrent reservations, partial paid fallback, provider earnings, refund/settlement races, media top-ups and orphan recovery. Never point these tests at a production database: the store harness truncates tables. `coordinator/store/model_token_zero_usage_test.go` rejects payouts or charges with no token usage on both backends. `coordinator/api/model_token_reconciliation_test.go` injects pre-commit failures and lost commit acknowledgements, replays reconciliation concurrently, verifies usage/key-spend/referral/platform accounting once, and exercises deterministic cash failures caused by price increases or usage overages.

```sh
cd coordinator
DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER@127.0.0.1:PORT/THROWAWAY_DB?sslmode=disable' \
  go test -race ./store -run TestModelTokenPromotion -count=1
go test -race ./api ./modelpolicy \
  -run 'Test(ModelTokenPromotion|ModelSpecificFirstContentDeadline|Bonsai|CustomFirstContent)' -count=1
```

`console-ui/src/components/app-providers/ModelTokenPromotionsProvider.test.tsx` covers read-only login discovery, explicit claims, sold-out/ineligible states, account-switch races and paid-fallback copy. `coordinator/store/model_token_claims_test.go` races 270 distinct claimants against a 250-grant cap and verifies the signup cutoff. `console-ui/src/lib/chat/stream-thinking.test.ts` checks that frontend thinking defaults on. `console-ui/src/lib/chat/errors.test.ts` preserves promotion errors instead of replacing them with a generic credit error. `python3 scripts/test-model-token-promotion.py` checks local-day boundaries across daylight-saving transitions. Operator steps: [model-token-promotions.md](../operations/model-token-promotions.md).

## Account-scoped first-content SLA

`coordinator/api/first_content_accounts_test.go` covers exact account/email selection, unrelated service accounts, header spoofing, public-model override precedence, disabled clocks and identity-store failures. `coordinator/api/first_content_accounts_integration_test.go` runs streaming and non-streaming requests through chat, Responses, completions and messages past the old deadline with hard TTFT rejection enabled; exempt requests omit their wire budget and scheduler ceiling, while the configured OpenRouter email still times out. The existing deadline/queue/retry/provider-wire suites explicitly opt their fixture account into the SLA. `coordinator/api/media_resolve_test.go` verifies a pinned exemption cannot be recomputed during media fetch.

### Replacement and reconnect coverage

`PlannedProviderDisconnectTests` exercises late-APNs and inventory reconnects
against a mock WebSocket coordinator while accepted work is held open.
`StandaloneLifecycleControlTests` holds a local response across a mailbox drain.
`LifecycleRecoveryRollbackTests` checks failures before and after command publication;
`ProcessLifecycleTests` verifies that lock acquisition cannot kill a live PID owner.
`TestRestartStatusReportsOwnerAuthorizationWithoutPublicGrant` checks explicit
owner authorization while retaining runtime/security denials.
