# Build

> Last updated: 2026-09-28 · commit `d89ef42be`

How to build every component of Darkbloom from a fresh clone: the Go
coordinator, the Rust prompt-contract sidecar, the Swift provider CLI (with its
source-matched `mlx.metallib`), and the console and marketing Next.js UIs.
`make build` builds those components; the admin UI is built separately below.

Registry-ID support changes Swift provider policy and Rust prompt normalization
together. Build the paired coordinator/sidecar/provider candidate; the v6
prompt contract cannot reuse a v5 cache identity. The follow-up retains the
merged native SDK pin and does not require new model weights. See
[prompt parity](test.md#9-prompt-contract-parity-fixtures-and-vectors) for the validation procedure.

Docs Lint needs Git history to validate moved source links in frozen records;
its checkout uses `fetch-depth: 0` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docs` job).

Changes to native loading estimates and retirement require a rebuilt provider
test product, not only a new CLI. Bind both products and the SDK/metallib to the
same checkout before running the [memory and lifecycle gates](test.md).
See [historical source references](historical-references.md) for local setup.

Native CI test isolation reuses these built test products and their staged
metallib; it does not rebuild or download a model. Follow the
[provider test procedure](test.md) to run GPU-global assertions in separate
processes with the exclusive opt-in scoped to the named test.

The [Bonsai performance qualification](test.md#bonsai-performance-qualification)
uses a separate optimized test build with `-enable-testing` and `-DDEBUG` for
test-only ownership/scheduler seams. Do not add these switches to the ordinary
production build or substitute its benchmark archive with a test binary.

Model publishing can pass `HUGGING_FACE_ARTIFACT_JSON` through
`scripts/publish-model.sh` to registration. See the
[model publishing procedure](../operations/model-migration.md).

The admin, smoke and fleet helpers use the tools pinned here. Their local fixture
checks are covered by [script validation](test.md#6-scripts-and-release-integrity);
the [dev operations runbook](../operations/dev-environment.md) covers invocation.

Profiler wire changes require both coordinator and provider builds; the shared
Go/Swift fixture and focused checks are described in [test.md](test.md) and
[prediction telemetry](../reference/prediction-decision-telemetry.md).

The `ProviderAppAttest` Swift target uses public DeviceCheck/Security APIs. Its [shadow packaging and live-validation requirements](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#packaging-and-live-acceptance) are separate from a successful local compile.

Provider signing, R2 staging and publication run in separate jobs in `.github/workflows/release-swift.yml`. `scripts/provider-release-publication.py` stages the final signed bundle under an immutable digest path, retains metadata, and gates publication on coordinator qualification. A staging or publication retry downloads and reuses the original signed artifact and does not rerun compilation or notarization. `scripts/provider_release_github.py` resumes draft/upload state, verifies asset hashes before publishing and never replaces completed mismatched bytes. See [build qualification](../operations/app-attest-build-qualification.md).

The revision publisher accepts optional per-version HF repo, commit and path-prefix flags. It runs the SwiftPM `darkbloom-publish` executable to hash
artifacts. It also needs Python 3 and the AWS CLI; use the existing pinned tools.
The [revision runbook](../operations/model-revisions.md) describes its invocation.

## SDK 27 release builds and caches

Serving performance work changes the pinned CBv2 library as well as the
provider. Initialize the recorded submodules before building, and retain
source-matched Metal libraries for benchmarks. The
[profile qualification procedure](serving-performance-qualification.md)
records the exact model/runtime/backend/hardware identity; a successful build
alone does not qualify a wider serving limit. Build hardware qualification
runners with `DARKBLOOM_SERVING_QUALIFICATION_BUILD=1 swift build -c release --build-tests -Xswiftc -enable-testing`;
this selects the dedicated `ServingQualificationTests` target, retaining
production optimization while allowing its tests to import internal APIs.
The ordinary package graph still includes all unit tests. Stage the runner's
Metal library with `scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh`
before invoking `scripts/run-serving-qualification.py`. The runner records
source, binary, model and runtime identity and does not install a provider.

The release pipeline runs optimized products and SDK qualification on separate
`xcode-27-xlarge` runners. Both call `.github/actions/provider-release-build/action.yml`;
only the optimized lane transfers an unsigned app and its file inventory to
signing. All binaries, SwiftPM resource bundles and the source-matched Metal
library travel together. Signing verifies the same-run artifact's source commit,
version, inventory and entitlements before importing its certificate.

`.github/workflows/provider-release-cache.yml` runs the same two lanes after
relevant `master` changes. Release tags can restore those default-branch caches;
they cannot reuse another tag's cache. Release-plumbing PRs run these lanes with
PR-scoped caches and no signing or publishing secrets. Changes to
`BoundedSingleConsumerPipeline.swift` or its tests also run both lanes to catch
shutdown lifetime regressions with the release compiler. Two concurrent SDK 27
runners are needed for the parallel wall-time benefit; a smaller runner quota
queues the jobs without changing their gates.

`scripts/provider-release-cache.py` (`keys`) separates optimized and qualification
Swift caches by selected compiler/SDK identity, machine architecture, absolute
checkout/toolchain paths, dependencies and build recipe. A source commit names an
immutable generation; restore prefixes stay inside that compatibility boundary.
The qualification lane separately caches Rust 1.88.0 dependencies and target
objects. It always cleans and recompiles the local `promptsidecar` package while
retaining third-party objects: independently restored Swift and Rust caches must
not combine source timestamps with a different generation of local Rust outputs.
The Metal helper retains its exact source/toolchain contract.
`scripts/prepare-metal-toolchain.py` requires the selected Xcode's Metal compiler
to execute successfully. A successful component download alone is insufficient:
it clears stale lookup state, waits a bounded interval for registration, and uses
Apple's explicit component export/import path if registration remains incomplete.
It never switches to an older Xcode or silently accepts an unavailable compiler.

The helper's `snapshot-mtimes` and `restore-mtimes` commands retain timestamps for
tracked files whose contents are unchanged. Changed/new files retain their fresh
timestamps and rebuild. Cached metadata never restores source contents or touches
untracked files, links, Git metadata or paths outside the checkout. These commands
make compilation incremental; every restored build still runs its build and
qualification commands. Only unsigned build directories are cached, never signing
keys or notarized bundles.

See the [release cache procedure](../operations/provider-release.md#prepare-and-check-release-caches)
for first-run costs and rerun behavior.

## Prerequisites

- Start commands from the repository root. Component examples that use
  `(cd path && command)` run in a subshell and preserve your current directory.

- **Toolchain via [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/).** Every version is pinned in
  [`mise.toml`](../../mise.toml); `mise install` installs them all.

  | Tool | Pin | Used by |
  |---|---|---|
  | `go` | `1.25.0` | coordinator, e2e (matches `go 1.25.0` in [`go.mod`](../../go.mod)) |
  | `rust` | `1.88.0` | `coordinator/promptsidecar` (matches `rust-version = "1.88"` in `coordinator/promptsidecar/Cargo.toml` and the `rust:1.88.0-alpine` builder in `coordinator/Dockerfile`) |
  | `node` | `22` | `console-ui`, `admin-ui` |
  | `swift` | `6.3` | `provider-swift` (the local `libs/mlx-swift` package declares `swift-tools-version: 6.3`; `provider-swift/Package.swift` itself is `6.1`) |
  | `python` | `3.12` | `scripts/*.py`, benchmark wrapper tests |
  | `jq`, `gh`, `awscli`, `gcloud` | `latest` | scripts, release and deploy tooling |

- **macOS on Apple Silicon** for anything under `provider-swift/` (MLX + Metal).
  The coordinator, sidecar, e2e harness, and UIs build on macOS or Linux.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools + `cmake`** (`brew install cmake`) — the metallib
  helper compiles MLX's Metal kernels with cmake.
- **Git submodules** checked out: `libs/mlx-swift`, `libs/mlx-swift-lm`,
  `libs/mlx` (`git clone --recurse-submodules …` or
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`). `provider-swift/Package.swift`
  depends on `../libs/mlx-swift` and `../libs/mlx-swift-lm` by local path.
- **Docker** only for the coordinator container image (step 9).

### Pinned MLX dependencies

The provider consumes the local packages through immutable Git submodule pins:

| Package | Merged revision | Included update |
|---|---|---|
| `libs/mlx-swift` | `0f4fe403bef6899e8a72882bc6d4036a7a62ae31` | [PR #28](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift/pull/28): exact constant reuse for eligible Bonsai packed projections |
| `libs/mlx-swift-lm` | `4101d4c1bfa6b3175e7f34393e8c235a75a7c1be` | [PR #170](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift-lm/pull/170): completed prefill receipts, confirmed-token timing and per-engine mixed-prefill policy |

Keep both local packages in the provider build. The SDK's standalone package
manifest can still reference a pre-merge Swift review revision; the nested-test
procedure in [test.md](test.md#4-provider-swift--unit-tests-with-a-source-matched-metallib) binds it to the recorded local
Swift gitlink. The MLX core and C-wrapper pins are unchanged by this update.
Rebuild the consumer after changing pins; earlier full-model measurements are
evidence for their recorded dependency set, not a new benchmark of these pins.
The pin uses merged SDK `main` history. Its production libraries and package
manifest match the reviewed head `b52335b839d80c8e6d4194ebbd8809d737cd8eb3`;
subsequent merged changes improve test reliability, fork CI and documentation.

### Native Flash-Next candidate

The Qwen 3.8 Next integration originally landed in
[SDK PR #149](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift-lm/pull/149), commit
`729fa45c67a8b1cb26b1debeacf7f1d16ef3a21e`. That commit's complete Git tree is identical
to the approved review head `ae3ecdc835a895091f8929749fdb3e14383295a9`.
The current SDK gitlink above retains this support. Use the recorded gitlink,
not a floating branch or a private experiment.

Use the repository-owned [conversion tools](../../scripts/qwen38_conversion/README.md)
for the pinned official source. Metadata verification is distinct from full
payload hashing; conversion validates each source shard and writes a new
output/manifest while retaining the trained assistant and packed PLE table.
Inspect the tool's storage requirements before full hashing or conversion and
coordinate the model/GPU operator. Never create a missing mount path or reuse
an existing output directory. These commands do not publish an artifact.

Before describing the candidate as reproducible:

1. Record the selected source trees/patch digests and approved immutable core,
   C, Swift, SDK and provider pins. Inspect the composed SDK's
   `libs/mlx-swift-lm/docs/qwen4/composition.md` for required source selection and
   excluded experiments.
2. Resolve CMake/package revisions and nested gitlinks in a fresh recursive
   private checkout. A machine-specific dependency symlink, local package
   override or unrecorded core patch does not close this gate. After each
   dependency merge, record the resulting approved commit, update its consumers
   and repeat affected checks; a review-head pin is not a final merged pin.
3. Build the provider with the source-matched metallib and required SwiftPM
   resources using the procedures below; record actual binary/library/resource
   identities. Source parsing alone is not a build or runtime test.
4. Complete the [candidate test matrix](test.md#native-flash-next-candidate)
   on that final artifact. Keep private draft staging, signing/release, model
   publication, catalog activation and deployment as distinct outcomes.

Current source and validation limits are in the
[candidate reference](../reference/qwen4-next-support.md#validation-status-and-next-gates).

SwiftPM may mark generated resource bundles hidden on macOS. The SDK's
`PagedAttentionResources.locate` must still discover their readable Metal
source inside its existing search roots. Do not clear filesystem flags or
disable paged eligibility to hide a failed preflight; keep sealed-app lookup
and conflicting-resource rejection intact. Stage and verify resources for
both the test host and any separately invoked CLI child.

Private prefill experiments, including packed-read lookahead and ordered NAX,
are excluded from this publication pin. Rebuild and rebind both the SDK tests and provider when its
gitlink changes; an earlier executable cannot qualify the new source merely
because the core metallib hash is unchanged.
Record the actual compiled NAX capability and precision posture; a hardware
product name does not prove which kernels or arithmetic were used.

The connected Go API matrix can reuse an independently hashed production
provider via `DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY`; it does not build or substitute a
different native runtime. Record the Go coordinator/test source separately.
The [connected qualification instructions](test.md#native-flash-next-candidate)
bind coordinator traffic and native metrics to one authenticated unified
provider, with the Python runner and original oracles owned by this repository.

### Repository layout for builders

| Path | Toolchain | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `go.mod` (repo root) | Go | Single module `github.com/eigeninference/d-inference`; contains `coordinator/...` and `e2e/...`. There is no `go.work` and no nested `go.mod`. |
| `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/` | Go | The coordinator binary (`main.go`). |
| `coordinator/promptsidecar/` | Rust | Crate `promptsidecar`, edition 2024, `Cargo.lock` committed; built with `--locked`. |
| `provider-swift/` | SwiftPM | Products: `darkbloom` (CLI), `darkbloom-enclave`, `darkbloom-fan-helper`, `darkbloom-publish`; libraries `ProviderCore`, `ProviderCoreFoundation`, `DarkbloomFan*`. Platform `macOS 14+`. |
| `console-ui/` | Next.js 16 / React 19 | `npm`; tests with Vitest. |
| `admin-ui/` | Next.js 16 / React 19 | `npm`; dev/start on port `4001`. |
| `landing/` | Next.js 16 / React 19 | Standalone npm app; `make landing` installs, lints, builds and runs route tests; dev/start on port `3008`. |
| `Makefile` | — | Every target below; `make help` lists them. |

Provider tests are grouped by subsystem inside their existing SwiftPM targets.
See [finding provider tests](test.md#finding-provider-tests) for the folder map;
`provider-swift/Package.swift` (`package`) retains recursive source discovery.
The [inference source map](../architecture/inference.md#code-map) locates engine,
memory, caching and request-processing code within the same `ProviderCore`
target; building these folders requires no separate products or commands.

## Steps

### 1. Install the toolchain and hooks

```bash
mise install                          # installs every pin in mise.toml
git submodule update --init --recursive
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # enables pre-commit + pre-push (see "Git hooks")
```

`mise` activates the pinned versions per shell; on macOS the system Xcode
`swift` is also acceptable for `provider-swift`.

### 2. Build everything

```bash
make build      # coordinator-build prompt-sidecar-build provider-build ui-build
make all        # test + build (see test.md)
```

Continue with the per-component steps when you need one piece or want to
understand what `make` runs.

### 3. Coordinator (Go)

The owned two-host Go fixture embeds `e2e/testbed/provider_host.py`; rebuild
its test binary after helper or lifecycle changes. The CPU-only
`TestPrepareConnectedInputBindings` check uses the actual fixture input/report
types to prepare canonical catalog entries before a physical run. The helper waits within the existing
five-minute prelaunch bound for GPU ≤42°C and load1 ≤4, under the same control
lease used after launch. See the [test procedure](test.md#connected-coordinatorprovider-http-cache-gate).

CI checks formatting of tracked Go source while preserving frozen report
evidence bytes; see the [coordinator checks](test.md#2-coordinator-go).

```bash
make coordinator-build            # cd coordinator && go build ./cmd/coordinator
make coordinator-build-linux      # GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 → coordinator/coordinator-linux
```

The host build writes `./coordinator/coordinator`. Version identity is injected
only by the container build (`-ldflags -X …api.BuildVersion/BuildCommit/BuildDate`
in `coordinator/Dockerfile`); a local `go build` reports `dev`/`unknown` on
`GET /health` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`, `handleHealth`).

### 4. Prompt-contract sidecar (Rust)

```bash
make prompt-sidecar-format   # cargo fmt --all -- --check
make prompt-sidecar-check    # cargo check --locked --all-targets; cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
make prompt-sidecar-build    # cargo build --locked --release --bin promptsidecar
make prompt-sidecar          # format + check + test + build
```

Output: `./coordinator/promptsidecar/target/release/promptsidecar`. The
coordinator container needs a **statically linked Linux binary**, built the way
`coordinator/Dockerfile` does it (stage `prompt-sidecar-builder`):

```bash
cd coordinator/promptsidecar
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --locked --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --bin promptsidecar
file target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/promptsidecar   # must say "statically linked" or "static-pie linked"
```

On macOS cross-compiling to musl needs a Linux linker; use the Docker build in
step 9 instead. `scripts/verify-prompt-sidecar-linux.sh <binary>` runs the
production prompt vectors against a Linux sidecar binary (CI job "Prompt
Sidecar Tests").

### 5. Provider CLI (Swift) with source-matched metallib

Build the test product again after changing fixture helpers or assertions;
`--skip-build` alone reuses the previous executable. The
[provider test procedure](test.md#4-provider-swift--unit-tests-with-a-source-matched-metallib)
covers isolated CLI configuration, artifact integrity, SSD authentication,
paged-preflight diagnostics, and stream ordering. Synthetic MLX fixtures need
the matched metallib; enabled live-model fixtures also need their documented
model inputs.

To compile all test targets without executing fixtures:

```bash
(cd provider-swift && swift build --build-tests)
```

```bash
make provider-build
# = cd provider-swift && swift build
#   ./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh "$(cd provider-swift && swift build --show-bin-path)"
```

`swift build` produces `./provider-swift/.build/debug/darkbloom` (plus
`darkbloom-enclave`, `darkbloom-fan-helper`, `darkbloom-publish`). MLX loads
`mlx.metallib` from **beside the running executable**, and SwiftPM does not
compile the Metal kernels, so [`scripts/fetch-metallib.sh`](../../scripts/fetch-metallib.sh)
builds them with cmake from `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx` (the exact source
the host side links) and copies the result next to the binary. Despite its
name it builds, it does not download.

MLX also embeds shader source in Cmlx for runtime compilation. After changing
an MLX kernel header, regenerate the affected embedded sources with
`libs/mlx-swift/Tools/update-mlx.sh` from a clean, isolated `libs/mlx-swift`
checkout and review its generated diff. For `quantized.h`, keep both
`Source/Cmlx/mlx-generated/quantized.cpp` and
`Source/Cmlx/mlx-generated/metal/quantized.h` synchronized with the core header.
Rebuild Cmlx and relink the provider as well as rebuilding `mlx.metallib`;
replacing the Metal library alone leaves the embedded QMV implementation intact.
Run the [bias-accumulation regression](test.md#quantized-bias-accumulation-regression)
against the resulting runtime.

```bash
./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh            # next to the latest debug build
./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh release    # next to the release build
./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh /some/dir  # → /some/dir/mlx.metallib
```

Knobs: `METALLIB_CACHE_DIR` (default `/tmp/mlx-metallib-cache`; cache key
includes the MLX tree SHA, toolchain hash and deployment target) and
`MLX_METALLIB_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` (default `26.2`; the `_nax` kernels are only
compiled at SDK/deployment target ≥ 26.2). The script fails if required kernel
symbols (`_nax`, `gemv`, the `affine_qmv_wide_*` variants) are missing from the
produced library.

After changing doctor subprocess capture or status canonicalization, rebuild
the Swift test targets with `cd provider-swift && swift build --build-tests`.
Then run the [focused capture and canonical-byte regressions](test.md#doctor-capture-and-attestation-canonical-bytes).

#### Instrumented candidate benchmarks

Build `radix-engine` with its matching native dependency and `RADIX_CANDIDATE`
define to emit schema-3 actual-forward-width evidence. The scalar observer and
benchmark validator must come from the same reviewed source cut. See the
[prefix-cache benchmark checks](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation) for
scope, completion and B2/B4 acceptance requirements.
The executable's `scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Package.resolved` is tracked
and pins the reviewed provider dependency set. Keep locked resolution enabled
and verify the resulting source graph when applying local package overrides.

#### Restored SwiftPM runtime resources

The Provider Tests job removes restored metallibs and resource bundles from
all macOS build configurations in both package caches before building its debug
test product (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). An inactive package's cached debug
bundle can contain older source just as a release bundle can. Each subsequent
package build recreates its own resources; compiled objects and dependency
checkouts remain cached. Runtime lookup accepts byte-identical copies and
continues to reject divergent copies.

The separate [signing-validation workflow](../operations/provider-release.md#environment-free-signing-validation)
checks packaging and Apple signing without selecting a deployment environment.

Release configuration, as the release workflow builds it:

```bash
cd provider-swift && swift build -c release --product darkbloom
swift build -c release --product darkbloom-fan-helper
cd .. && ./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh release
```

`darkbloom --version` must print the value of `ProviderCore.version`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderCore.swift`);
`scripts/check-release-version.sh` enforces this against the coordinator's
`LatestProviderVersion` (see [../operations/provider-release.md](../operations/provider-release.md)).

For a signed provider bundle needed by isolated tests, use the
[validation-only signing workflow](../operations/provider-release.md#signed-validation-bundle).
It retains an Actions artifact after the normal signing and final-bundle checks.

#### Standalone attention operator replay

[`scripts/benchmarks/attention-replay`](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention-replay/Package.swift)
links only MLX and MLXLMCommon. It consumes validated packet bytes without loading
a model or provider. Use an isolated build directory and the reviewed dependency
pins/local MLX package binding from the replay validation manifest:

```bash
REPLAY_SOURCE_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/pinned-worktree
ATTENTION_REPLAY_SOURCE_ROOT="$REPLAY_SOURCE_ROOT" \
  swift build --package-path "$REPLAY_SOURCE_ROOT/scripts/benchmarks/attention-replay" \
    --scratch-path /absolute/path/to/replay-build \
    -c release --product attention-replay --jobs 4 --disable-automatic-resolution
```

Retain the executable SHA-256, source/dependency inventory, build graph,
`mlx.metallib` and SwiftPM resource bundles. An executable hash alone does not
bind external Metal resources. The Python driver never builds or downloads them.
Use the [offline NumPy environment](#offline-attention-analysis-environment) for
packet validation and the independent reference. See [replay validation](test.md#attention-operator-replay)
and the [source/test milestone](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-operator-replay.md).

#### Segmented metadata profiler

Build the native `BenchSegmentedDecode` target in an isolated directory with the
same pinned local MLX dependency used by the nested native tests:

```bash
swift build --package-path libs/mlx-swift-lm --scratch-path /absolute/path/to/segment-profiler-build \
  -c release --product BenchSegmentedDecode --jobs 4 --disable-automatic-resolution
```

Stage the matching `mlx.metallib` and SwiftPM resource bundles beside the binary,
and retain their hashes with the build's source/dependency inventory. See
[profiler validation](test.md#segmented-metadata-profiler) for the bounded run.

<a id="resident-prefix-benchmark-executable"></a>

#### Prefix-cache benchmark executable

[`scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine`](../../scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Package.swift)
links the real provider factory and MLX packages from an explicitly selected
worktree. Keep baseline and candidate source worktrees separate, with recursive
submodules pinned. From the repository root:

```bash
RADIX_BENCH_SOURCE=/absolute/path/to/pinned-worktree
cp "$RADIX_BENCH_SOURCE/provider-swift/Package.resolved" scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Package.resolved
RADIX_SOURCE_ROOT="$RADIX_BENCH_SOURCE" RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=0 \
  swift build --package-path scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine \
    --scratch-path "$RADIX_BENCH_SOURCE/provider-swift/.build" \
    -c release --product radix-engine --jobs 4 --disable-automatic-resolution
```

Use `RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=1` for a source tree containing
`EngineV2Factory.makeBenchmarkSession` and the current cache APIs. The same
harness source compiles against the older baseline with `0`. Candidate SSD mode
uses the normal slot factory after a fresh pre/post-load weight-hash check;
`--cache-mode resident` explicitly reproduces the earlier resident-cache arm.
The baseline conditional and resident reproduction use the direct production
engine factory (`BenchmarkLoader.swift`).

The paired persistent-test namespace/access-group options require a candidate
build containing `SSDPersistentTestKeyNamespace`; historical builds reject them.
The same `RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=1` define also enables the namespace test target.
Building this source does not authorize a Keychain group or establish persistent
restart. See [isolated persistent namespace validation](test.md#isolated-persistent-test-namespace).

Archive the source manifest, compile define, binary hash, matching
`mlx.metallib`, and SwiftPM resource bundles before changing that source tree.
Stage the Metal library beside `radix-engine`, as for the provider CLI. Before
model loading, the candidate SSD harness calls `bindRuntimeMetallibForMLX`, the
normal startup binder, and requires a valid immutable digest; placing the file
beside the binary alone does not establish the identity used by the complete
cache (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Security/BinaryHasher.swift`). The
benchmark session is exposed only through `@_spi(Benchmarking)`; its raw events
preserve token IDs. Segmented storage uses the shared native process owner;
bridge dispatch, contiguous bridge admission and HTTP framing require the
separate provider HTTP probe. See [cache validation](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation)
for replay, key-mode and process-restart requirements.

The current candidate accepts `--concurrency 1|2|4` and either
`--production-kv-grant` or `--kv-budget-gib N` after its positional arguments.
Archive one binary for all compared arms. Use `--production-kv-grant` for the
single-model production-capacity run: the existing slot session derives its
logical grant from loaded target and assistant weights using the
[production grant policy](../architecture/hardware-support.md#kv-slot-grants).
Archive the Python evaluator source with the binary evidence as well: the
schema-2 cache comparator requires an off-to-on pair and validates idle/shutdown
ownership. A binary whose terminal snapshots precede publication of retired
engine gauges cannot satisfy that idle gate; preserve the raw refusal and use
a harness with coherent observations for the final comparison
(`scripts/benchmarks/radix_engine_evidence.py`, `retirement_errors`).
The current candidate includes bounded observation of published idle snapshots.
Its pure `BenchmarkIdleObservationTests` target can be run with `swift test`
using the same package, pinned source environment and scratch path as the build.
Keep test and release artifacts distinct, and use the final release binary for
both compared arms. Preserve logs that name the executed Swift Testing cases;
an XCTest runner may report zero tests before Swift Testing executes its suite.
It retains the separate post-build live OS/activation headroom gate.
The mode requires the candidate SSD serving path; it cannot be combined with
resident reproduction, native-probe-only mode or an explicit grant
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+BenchmarkGrant.swift`,
`benchmarkProductionGrant`; `BenchmarkOptions.swift`).

For explicit envelope controls, use `--kv-budget-gib N`. Without either flag,
the existing default remains one request and a 16 GiB explicit slot grant.
Explicit mode retains its measured post-load allocator guard; that diagnostic
does not size a production grant. Candidate `paged_storage` metrics separately
report committed backing and the mutable logical grant. Follow the
[validation steps](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation) to retain policy
inputs, live headroom and actual engine capacity with each result.

For a bounded target diagnostic, append `--native-kv-probe-only` with
`cache-off mtp-off` and concurrency one. This candidate-only mode loads the
verified model and runs the same native KV type probe used before paged backend
construction: two prefill tokens followed by one decode token. It records each
attention row's actual K/V types and shapes, with model and metallib hashes.
It creates no serving engine or SSD store.

The standalone product also includes optional bounded target-logit capture through
`--logit-diagnostic-position` and `--logit-diagnostic-candidates`. Build it with the
matching native submodule; follow the [diagnostic procedure](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation)
to preserve the original request and compare observation against an uninstrumented
control. These flags belong to the standalone benchmark, not the provider CLI.

The matching native submodule also supports `--attention-packet-position` and
`--attention-packet-layer` for a bounded native-byte capture from one attention
owner. Follow the [capture procedure](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation)
before passing the exported packet to the offline analyzer below.

#### Offline attention analysis environment

The optional [attention packet analyzer](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention_packet/FORMAT.md)
uses a separate Python environment and the pinned NumPy requirement. It needs
no Swift build, model weights or GPU.

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv
/tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv/bin/python -m pip install -r scripts/benchmarks/attention_packet/requirements.txt
```

Use that interpreter for [packet analysis and its tests](test.md#offline-attention-packet-analysis).

### 6. Console UI (Next.js)

```bash
make ui-install   # cd console-ui && npm install
make ui-lint      # npx eslint src/
make ui-test      # npm test  (vitest run)
make ui-build     # npm run build  (next build)
make ui           # install + lint + test + build
```

Local dev server: `cd console-ui && npm run dev`. Bundle budget check:
`npm run bundle:check` (`console-ui/scripts/analyze-bundle.mjs`). CI uses
`npm ci`.

### 7. Admin UI (Next.js)

No `make` target. From `admin-ui/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint     # eslint src/
npm test         # vitest run
npm run build    # next build
npm run dev      # next dev -p 4001
```

### 8. Landing page

The imported Next.js site lives in `landing/` and has its own npm
lockfile and configuration. It does not depend on the eigen-homepages
workspace. From the repository root:

```bash
make landing
cd landing && npm run dev
```

Copy `landing/.env.example` to `.env.local` inside that directory to
configure runtime integrations. A production build needs no credentials.
The hosting root is `landing`, with the Next.js preset; its API routes
require a server runtime rather than a static export. See the
[marketing README](../../landing/README.md) for deployment handoff.

### 9. Coordinator container image

The production image is built by [`coordinator/Dockerfile`](../../coordinator/Dockerfile)
from the **repo root** (it copies both `coordinator/` and the sidecar crate):

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg BUILD_VERSION="$(awk -F'"' '/public static let version =/ {print $2}' provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderCore.swift)" \
  --build-arg BUILD_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -f coordinator/Dockerfile -t coordinator:local .
```

Stages: `prompt-sidecar-builder` (`rust:1.88.0-alpine`, musl static build) →
`builder` (`golang:1.25-alpine`, `-ldflags` version injection) → final image
`FROM eigengajesh/d-inference-base:v1-amd64` with `/usr/local/bin/coordinator`
and `/usr/local/bin/promptsidecar`, OCI labels
`org.opencontainers.image.{version,revision,created}`, `EXPOSE 8080`, entrypoint
`start.sh` (`coordinator/deploy/start.sh`). Cloud Build wraps exactly this in
`deploy/gcp/cloudbuild.yaml` (dev) and `deploy/gcp/cloudbuild-prod.yaml`
(prod); see [`../operations/coordinator-deploy.md`](../operations/coordinator-deploy.md).

### 10. Use the database-only coordinator command

The normal coordinator build also supports `coordinator --migrate-only`. It
requires `EIGENINFERENCE_DATABASE_URL`, runs store migrations, and exits without
starting the server or seeding an admin key. Container execution must override
the default MicroMDM entrypoint script; see the
[deployment procedure](../operations/coordinator-deploy.md#optional-prepare-compatible-migrations-before-draining).

The [startup measurement tool](../operations/coordinator-startup-measurement.md)
requires Python 3.10+ and no third-party packages or build step. Its tests use
local stub servers; its default observation mode sends only public GETs.

## `make` targets

| Target | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `help` | List targets (default goal) |
| `coordinator-test` | `cd coordinator && go test ./...` |
| `coordinator-build` | `go build ./cmd/coordinator` → `./coordinator/coordinator` |
| `coordinator-build-linux` | `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o coordinator-linux ./cmd/coordinator` |

## Git hooks

Enable once with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Both hooks only act on
components that changed.

| Hook | Trigger | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| [`.githooks/pre-commit`](../../.githooks/pre-commit) | staged `coordinator/**.go` | `gofmt -l` on the staged files (fix: `gofmt -w <file>`) |
| | staged `console-ui/**.ts{,x}` | `cd console-ui && npx eslint src/` (fix: `npx eslint --fix src/`) |
| | Swift | skipped — no enforced formatter |
| [`.githooks/pre-push`](../../.githooks/pre-push) | any `coordinator/` change in the pushed range | `gofmt -l .` over `coordinator/`, then `go test $(go list ./... \| grep -v /internal/api)` from `coordinator/` (the slow WebSocket integration tests run in CI only) |
| | any `console-ui/` change | `npx eslint --quiet src/` and `npm run build` |

CI runs the fuller set (`gofmt`, `golangci-lint`, `-race` tests, Swift, Rust,
docs lint); see [test.md](test.md).

## Verify

```bash
make build
ls -l coordinator/coordinator coordinator/promptsidecar/target/release/promptsidecar
ls -l provider-swift/.build/debug/darkbloom provider-swift/.build/debug/mlx.metallib
./provider-swift/.build/debug/darkbloom --version    # prints ProviderCore.version, e.g. 0.8.16
ls console-ui/.next
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `swift build` cannot resolve `../libs/mlx-swift` | submodules not checked out | `git submodule update --init --recursive` |
| provider starts but MLX fails to load kernels / "metallib not found" | `mlx.metallib` missing beside the binary | `./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh` (or `make provider-build`) |
| `fetch-metallib.sh` fails on missing `_nax` symbols | deployment target/SDK below 26.2 | update Xcode; or set `MLX_METALLIB_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` only if you accept a kernel set that differs from release builds |
| `cargo build --locked` fails on lockfile | `Cargo.lock` out of date with `Cargo.toml` | run `cargo update -p <crate>` deliberately and commit the lock; never drop `--locked` in CI |
| `go build` picks a different Go | `mise` not activated in this shell | `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` (or zsh) then retry |
| `docker build` fails at `file … statically linked` | sidecar not statically linked (musl target missing) | the Dockerfile adds the target itself; check Docker platform is `linux/amd64` |

## App Attest release qualification

Use the macOS 27 SDK for a candidate that needs Apple code-measurement extensions. The release workflow explicitly selects Command Line Tools 27.0 / Swift 6.4, then runs provider tests under that same SDK; ordinary development retains the Swift 6.3 minimum. Set `SDKROOT` to that SDK for both compilation and linking: a CLT 27 beta 6 Swift probe compiled with `--sdk` alone embedded the deployment target as its SDK; setting `SDKROOT` produced the correct linked SDK. Verify `LC_BUILD_VERSION` with `xcrun vtool -show-build` on the final executable. Confirm the final signed executable produces the current launch category and full CodeDirectory digest on physical macOS 27; SDK 26 builds can collect ordinary shadow proofs but cannot qualify replacement readiness. See the [observed SDK and measurement contract](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#macos-sdk-and-signed-code-measurements).

Run `go test ./appattest ./api ./store -run 'TestAppAttest|TestAuthorization|TestApple|TestMacCodeMeasurement'`
from `coordinator/`, using a disposable local `DATABASE_URL` for the store
contracts (the test harness truncates tables). Add `-race` for concurrency checks.
Run `swift test --filter ProviderAppAttestTests` from `provider-swift/`.
The private admin queries have PostgreSQL coverage in
`admin-ui/src/lib/queries/app-attest.test.ts` and
`admin-ui/src/lib/queries/app-attest-diagnostics.test.ts`.

After the optimized provider is packaged with its resources, run
`DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_CHUNK_EVAL=18 MLX_GEMMA4_FUSED_WEIGHTED_UNSORT=1 MLX_GATHER_QMM_EXPERT_SLICES=1 Darkbloom.app/Contents/MacOS/darkbloom runtime-smoke`
(the child validates retained latches that MLX reads at its first Metal touch,
so the caller seeds them, exactly as `SelfUpdater` and `install.sh` do). Require all four markers:
`app-attest-callback-runtime-smoke: ok`, `gemma-optimizations-runtime-smoke: ok`,
`paged-kernel-runtime-smoke: ok`, and `qwen4-metal-resources-runtime-smoke: ok`. Callback completion and expiry are exercised
without Apple service calls or a Keychain item. This linked-binary check catches
a release-only allocator failure that debug tests missed. Run
`bash scripts/test-install-atomic.sh` for installer acceptance and rollback cases.
The [rollout runbook](../operations/app-attest-rollout.md) separates these checks
from real Apple receipt renewal and final signed-artifact fleet qualification.

Candidate native prefix-cache benchmarks must build ProviderCore and

### Qwen packaged resource regression

`python3 scripts/test-qwen4-packaged-resources.py` compiles the actual Qwen Metal resource accessor into a small optimized app, then runs it from a relocated app and an installer-style executable symlink. It checks all three preamble hashes, rejects missing or empty files and resource links outside the app, and proves that developer/cwd copies cannot mask a broken packaged resource. It needs Swift on macOS, but no model weights or GPU. Both SDK 27 release lanes and Provider Tests run this check. The full provider `runtime-smoke` exercises the same accessor before publication, installation, and update.

Provider Tests also runs `python3 scripts/test-profile-inventory-auth.py` on macOS. It compiles the production `ProfileInventoryAuthorization` helper into a terminal fixture without invoking real `sudo` or changing profiles; the test procedure is in [test.md](test.md).

## Promotion payload helper

`python3 scripts/model-token-promotion.py --help` prepares a model-specific, calendar-day grant payload without making API calls. It requires Python with `zoneinfo` and timezone data. The [promotion runbook](../operations/model-token-promotions.md) covers review and approved application; the [test guide](test.md) covers calendar and settlement validation.

## Source-matched test libraries

After `swift build --build-tests`, run `scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh` with the
package's `swift build --show-bin-path` directory. The helper builds or verifies
the matching MLX library and stages it beside each test executable and in the
nested resource bundle used by native checkpoint identity tests. `make provider-test`
and the provider/nested CI jobs invoke this helper. A missing test runner or
failed source verification is an error; an existing library is always replaced.
See [the live-test setup](test.md) for the pinned DiffusionGemma artifact and
opt-in encrypted transport gate.
