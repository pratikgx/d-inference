# Reports — dated records

> Last updated: 2026-09-28 · commit `d89ef42be`

Frozen records: incident analyses, measurements, experiment results, and
migration records. Each file describes the code **as it was on its date**; none
is edited after it lands, and none describes the current system. For how things
work today read [`../architecture/README.md`](../architecture/README.md); for
what was decided and whether it shipped read [`../design/README.md`](../design/README.md).

File names start with the date of the work (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`). Each file's
freshness stamp carries its own date, not the current one.

- [GPT-OSS B2 cache divergence](2026-09-06-gptoss-b2-cache-divergence.md) — retained three-arm pilot passes strict cache-off backend comparison but fails strict cache parity; cross-row equality does not prove restoration correctness.
- [Fixed-context Qwen and Gemma scores](2026-09-06-teacher-context-scores.md) — all four real-model scoring controls run successfully; Qwen differs at two of 83 positions and Gemma at zero of 61, with numerical acceptance still open.

- [Connected Qwen3.8 HTTP coverage and missing SSD publication](2026-09-05-connected-http3-donation.md) — ten cache-off cases pass on the rebuilt CLI; the SSD donor stores a checkpoint but publishes no ready event, so the paired gate fails.
- [Qwen3.6 backend parity regression](2026-09-05-qwen36-backend-parity-regression.md) — both within-backend SSD pairs pass, but contiguous/paged outputs differ with normal MTP and with MTP off; default promotion held.
