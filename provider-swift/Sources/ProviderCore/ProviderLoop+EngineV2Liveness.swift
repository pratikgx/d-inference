/// ProviderLoop -- wedge self-recovery for v2 slots (v0.7.5 §1.10).
///
/// Port of the legacy `BatchScheduler+Liveness.selfRestartForRecovery`
/// (wedge verdict → full engine reload) onto the one-engine slot shape.
/// The v2 engine detects wedges (`WedgeMonitor` + `stepsExecuted` flatline
/// → heartbeat state "crashed") but a wedged CBv2 step loop cannot heal
/// itself; this driver HEALS by rebuilding the engine over the RETAINED
/// container — the weights stay resident, so recovery costs an engine
/// construction, not a multi-minute weight reload (much cheaper than the
/// legacy full `loadModel` restart).
///
/// State machine, driven from the capacity-refresh tick (heartbeat/2
/// cadence — the same place the wedge verdict already surfaces via
/// `updateAggregateCapacity` → `backendSlotCapacity`):
///
///   serving ──confirmed wedge (≥120s stall + step flatline)──▶ recovering
///     recovering: telemetry `engine_v2_self_restart` (ERROR)
///                 → old bridge marked "reloading" (heartbeat honesty)
///                 → drain: cancel pumps + bounded engine drain
///                 → rebuild engine+bridge over the SAME container, preserving
///                   target-only posture or moving the already-bound assistant
///                 → if assistant revalidation fails, atomically install
///                   target-only sizing/status and re-slice the freed bytes
///                 → swap the ModelSlot's bridge → serving
///     recovering ──rebuild throws──▶ unload (fail loud: slot gone, the
///                 coordinator's heartbeat view drops it and routes around)
///   serving ──second confirmed wedge INSIDE the 120s cooldown──▶ unload
///                 (legacy `livenessRestartCooldown` semantic: never
///                 thrash rebuilds; requests 503 / deroute instead)
///
/// Serialization: the drain→rebuild→swap stretch holds the RE-SLICE GATE
/// (grants are read + re-granted across suspension points — a concurrent
/// load's shrink or an unload's regrow must never interleave, or the
/// rebuilt engine would carry a stale grant and Σ(grants) ≤ budget could
/// break). Eviction/idle-unload of the recovering slot is prevented by a
/// synthetic in-flight pin in `requestToModel` (the same signal every
/// eviction filter and the idle monitor already honor); explicit unloads
/// (retirement, shutdown) win by design — every suspension point re-checks
/// slot identity and aborts the swap if the slot vanished or was replaced.
///
/// Requests DURING the window (the slot stays installed — same as the
/// legacy reload): a NEW submission after the drain is rejected by the
/// engine with the shutdown sentinel, which the bridge maps to the
/// canonical queue-full message → 429 + Retry-After (retryable capacity,
/// pre-content — the coordinator reroutes invisibly; pinned by test). The
/// requests already IN FLIGHT at drain are the wedged ones — hanging with
/// zero content for ≥ 120s — and get teardown terminals exactly as the
/// legacy restart's abort gave them; their consumers were already
/// rerouted by pre-content failover when the wedge began, and the
/// heartbeat has been derouting the slot ("crashed" from 10s, then
/// "reloading") the whole time.
///
/// Config/env parity with legacy: NONE — the legacy watchdog had no
/// env/config gate (always on, 120s wedge threshold from the pending
/// timeout, 120s restart cooldown); this port keeps all three semantics
/// and adds no new knobs.
