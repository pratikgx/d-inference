// Event-triggered heartbeat policy (routing v2, Phase 1).
//
// The 5s heartbeat interval is the staleness window that produced the
// gray-box incident (coordinator/registry/budget_clamp.go: 11,581
// capacity-shaped 503s in 6h from boxes whose heartbeats looked ~1.4%
// utilized). The fix is push-based freshness: when slot state materially
// changes, send the EXISTING heartbeat payload immediately instead of waiting
// out the interval. The baseline periodic heartbeat remains as liveness.
//
// Two pure value types, deliberately free of clocks, tasks, and actors:
//   * `CapacityHeartbeatMateriality` decides whether a freshly rebuilt
//     capacity payload differs enough from the last SENT one to justify an
//     out-of-band heartbeat.
//   * `CapacityHeartbeatThrottle` rate-caps event sends at 2/s per connection
//     with trailing-edge coalescing: a change landing inside the cap window
//     is never dropped — it is guaranteed exactly one heartbeat at window
//     end. Callers inject `now` (deterministic clock seam) and own the timer
//     that services `.scheduled` verdicts.
//
// The ProviderLoop drives both from `updateAggregateCapacity()` — the single
// choke point every trigger in the contract already flows through: request
// admission and completion/cancellation, model load/unload/evict, wedge
// recovery ("crashed"/"reloading" slot states surface in the rebuilt
// payload), and token-budget drift.
