// Bridge between `MLXLMServer.MLXServerEngine` (a single-engine contract)
// and Darkbloom's multi-model EngineV2 slot registry. The provider loads N
// models concurrently, one `EngineV2Bridge` per model, and dispatches each
// incoming OpenAI request by `request.model` to the matching bridge.
//
// The upstream library ships with `MLXBatchedEngineServerEngine`, but
// that type owns exactly one `BatchedEngine` and is intended for the
// single-model `mlx-server` executable. Our provider needs the LRU /
// idle / reservation policy that lives in `StandaloneServer` and
// `ProviderLoop`, so we keep the registry on this side and only expose
// the `MLXServerEngine` shape upstream wants.
//
// Concurrency model: the engine is a value-type `struct` that holds an
// immutable closure (`registryProvider`). Mutable inference state lives in
// actor-isolated EngineV2 bridges, so `Sendable` is trivially satisfied.
//
// Companion files:
//   - `MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngine+Registry.swift`
//     defines the nested `ModelRegistryEntry` / `AcquiredModel` types
//     and the top-level `OneShotRelease` actor.
//   - `MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngine+Translation.swift`
//     houses `translate(openAIRequest:)` and the `templateMessageDict`
//     helper used by `applyTemplate`.
//   - `MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngineError.swift`
//     owns the typed error surface and the scheduler-message parser.
